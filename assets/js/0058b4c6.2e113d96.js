These variables change according to feedback loops: higher transaction counts lead to increased fee revenue, but they also expand the ledger. Operators monitor when the cost of storing additional data exceeds the economic benefits of the increased fees.

But how does it fare against heavyweights like Solana, Ethereum, and Bitcoin, especially for use cases like microtransactions, DeFi, or voting? We\u2019ve crafted a scorecard comparing these blockchains across seven key metrics - Throughput, Fee Predictability, Fee Loss Protection, Latency, Decentralization, Security, and Scalability. With a nod to Solana\u2019s user experience (UX) struggles around fee loss, let\u2019s see why Leios could shine."},"leios-cost-analysis":{"id":"leios-cost-analysis","title":"Understanding Leios - A Look at Cost Estimates for Cardano\u2019s Next Step","description":"At IOG, we\u2019re thrilled about the Leios project, a major leap toward enhancing Cardano\u2019s scalability and efficiency.

Leios could push Cardano from a modest 5\u201310 transactions per second (TPS) to an impressive 100 TPS, with sights set on 1,000+ TPS. This leap, paired with Cardano\u2019s focus on security, predictable fees, and 3,000 stake pools, opens doors to use cases that other blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana can\u2019t easily match.

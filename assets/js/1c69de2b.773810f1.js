They introduced two key efficiency metrics to quantify system performance:\\n\\n- *Temporal efficiency*, which measures the fraction of submitted transactions that make it into the ledger, with nearly 100% indicating optimal transaction inclusion\\n- *Spatial efficiency*, which represents the ratio of transaction size to total ledger size (including IBs, EBs, and RBs), with higher values indicating better storage optimization.\\n\\nRecent revisions to Full Short Leios have shown promising improvements in both efficiency metrics. The simulations revealed an average transaction lifecycle of approximately 100 seconds from submission to ledger inclusion.\\n\\nThe analysis produced several key visualizations that demonstrate the system\'s performance:\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n![Temporal efficiency bar chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/refs/heads/main/analysis/sims/2025w19/plots/temporal-efficiency-bar.svg)\\n\\n*Figure 1: Temporal efficiency comparison across different transaction rates*\\n\\n![Temporal efficiency time series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/1a7ccb588bf87284858c05a0670b938b5d35c417/analysis/sims/2025w19/plots/temporal-efficiency-timeseries.svg)\\n\\n*Figure 2: Temporal efficiency trends over time*\\n\\n![Spatial efficiency analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/refs/heads/main/analysis/sims/2025w19/plots/spatial-efficiency.svg)\\n\\n*Figure 3: Spatial efficiency analysis showing ledger optimization*\\n\\n![Transaction lifecycle visualization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/refs/heads/main/analysis/sims/2025w19/plots/reach-rb-tx.svg)\\n\\n*Figure 4: Transaction lifecycle from submission to ledger inclusion*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Protocol documentation and analysis\\n\\nThe team conducted an extensive analysis of transaction throughput and block characteristics, producing several key visualizations:\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n![Transaction throughput analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/refs/heads/main/analysis/block-praos-leios-contour.svg)\\n\\n*Figure 5: Transaction throughput as a function of block size and rate*\\n\\n![Comparative transaction lifecycle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/refs/heads/main/analysis/tx-to-block-fig.svg)\\n\\n*Figure 6: Comparative transaction lifecycle between Praos and Leios*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nThe team also completed a comprehensive profitability analysis for Leios SPOs, considering various deployment scenarios:\\n- Evaluated infrastructure costs across premium and value cloud providers\\n- Demonstrated profitability without reserve contributions at 50+ TPS\\n- Documented the impact of diminishing future rewards due to reserve depletion\\n- Analyzed comparative economics between Praos and Leios SPOs.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n![Profitability forecast visualization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/refs/heads/main/analysis/leios-forecast-sqrt-fill.svg)\\n\\n*Figure 7: Profitability forecast for Leios SPOs without reserve contributions*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Security and infrastructure improvements\\n\\nThe team addressed several security vulnerabilities in web applications through a series of patches:\\n- Fixed minor and moderate security issues in [#321](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/pull/321), [#322](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/pull/322), [#323](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/pull/323), and [#325](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/pull/325) pull requests.\\n\\n### Protocol enhancements\\n\\nRecent protocol improvements include:\\n- Implementation of revisions to Full Short Leios design to enhance both temporal and spatial efficiency\\n- Optimization of protocol parameters for improved transaction processing\\n- Development of a new sharding strategy in Rust simulation\\n- Enhanced logging system for tracking spatial efficiency metrics.\\n\\nFor more detailed information about the simulations and analysis, please refer to the [analysis documentation](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/tree/main/analysis) and the [profitability analysis notebook](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/analysis/profitability-leios.ipynb)."},{"id":"/2025/04/28/weekly-progress-summary","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2025/04/28/weekly-progress-summary","source":"@site/news/2025-04-28-weekly-progress-summary.md","title":"Weekly Summary \u2013 April 28, 2025","description":"This week, the Leios team made significant progress in protocol documentation, simulation improvements, and transaction lifecycle analysis.

The last two, IOPS and memory cost, will be added during this month.\\n\\nOn the [last and third day](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/workshop/day-3-recap.md), the team consolidated their options for how optimistic validation of input blocks can be accomplished. They defined three candidates, with one being favored. The main goal was to support the chaining of transactions with Leios, which requires defining a \'point in time\' or stage of the protocol at which a subsequent or chained transaction can be built on top of an already submitted transaction. This can be achieved by having the node optimistically compute prospective ledger states using its local knowledge of input blocks referenced in certified endorser blocks or possibly ranking blocks.\\n\\n- [Day 1](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/workshop/day-1-recap.md)\\n\\n- [Day 2](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/workshop/day-2-recap.md)\\n\\n- [Day 3](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/workshop/day-3-recap.md).\\n\\n\\n## Simulation progress\\n\\n- **Haskell simulation**\\n  - Added support for dishonest nodes that diffuse an unbounded amount of old IBs, enabling further analysis of freshest-first and oldest-first vote delivery scenarios\\n  - Identified and fixed a bug in configuration generation for simulation runs, which was causing inconsistencies in vote delivery between default and uniform/extended voting schemes\\n  - Added an `adversarial` field to the network topology schema, allowing for the simulation of unbounded IB diffusion by dishonest nodes.\\n\\n## Ongoing investigations\\n\\n- Investigating the effects of unbounded IB diffusion on IB delivery reliability and protocol performance under such conditions\\n- Working on quantifying settlement times and their impact on protocol performance\\n- Exploring integration possibilities with Ouroboros Peras, mainly focusing on potentially reusing their voting mechanism to reduce resource consumption.\\n\\n## Additional resources\\n\\n- [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/discussions/243) \u2013 EB ledger states and \'history rewriting\' effects\\n- [The First Full Leios simulation analysis](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/analysis/sims/2025w13/analysis.ipynb) \u2013 detailed analysis of the latest simulation results."},{"id":"/2025/03/24/weekly-progress-summary","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2025/03/24/weekly-progress-summary","source":"@site/news/2025-03-24-weekly-progress-summary.md","title":"Weekly Summary \u2013 March 24, 2025","description":"This week, the Leios team continued working on various aspects of the protocol and its simulation capabilities.

The discussion was facilitated by [Denicio Bernier](https://x.com/DenicioBernier) and [Rick McCracken](https://x.com/RichardMcCrackn), and was meant to provide a broad overview of _Leios_, the protocol and the R&D project we have just started working on.\\n\\nWe first went through Pi\'s presentation, recalling how _Ouroboros Praos_ works in broad terms and the problem Leios provides a solution for, namely the low throughput of the network. This low throughput is a necessity imposed by diffusion delays across a world spanning network, and constraints of the stake-based sortition algorithm that\'s used to select block-forging leader. By deconnecting the data diffusion and validation process from the blockchain extension process, trading throughput for latency, Leios aims at dramatically increase the number of transactions that can be processed by Cardano.\\n\\nWe then took questions from the audience, detailing some aspects of the protocol, while answering expectations from the community like the expected throughput and availability of benchmarks, the anticipated timeline for Leios, its possible usage for transient data diffusion, and its relationship with other expected Ouroboros extensions like [Peras](https://peras.cardano-scaling.org).\\n\\n* Original [blog post](https://cardano.org/news/2024-06-14-media-understanding-leios-with-pi-lanningham-arnaud-bailly/) on Cardano.org\\n* [X/Twitter](https://x.com/Cardano/status/1802717851544915972) thread\\n* Discussion recording on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpXS9lgL6BA&t=3s)."}]}}')}}]);

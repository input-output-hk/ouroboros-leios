Low EB rates result in many orphaned IBs\\n4.

They explored various ledger design options, including *labeled UTXOs* and *accounts* approaches, with detailed consideration of fees, collateral, and conflict prevention mechanisms. The team also discussed conformance testing approaches, including *QuickCheck dynamic and trace verification* methods.\\n\\nOn [day two](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/workshop/day-2-recap.md), the team made significant progress towards estimating the cost of running a Leios node, considering different cost items such as network egress, CPU, and storage. They analyzed resource usage across different TPS levels, from 10 TPS to 1K TPS, and discovered that while there\u2019s significant overhead at low throughput, the protocol becomes more efficient at higher TPS levels. The team hasn\u2019t been able to finish all the cost items yet. The last two, IOPS and memory cost, will be added during this month.\\n\\nOn the [last and third day](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/workshop/day-3-recap.md), the team consolidated their options for how optimistic validation of input blocks can be accomplished. They defined three candidates, with one being favored. The main goal was to support the chaining of transactions with Leios, which requires defining a \'point in time\' or stage of the protocol at which a subsequent or chained transaction can be built on top of an already submitted transaction. This can be achieved by having the node optimistically compute prospective ledger states using its local knowledge of input blocks referenced in certified endorser blocks or possibly ranking blocks.\\n\\n- [Day 1](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/workshop/day-1-recap.md)\\n\\n- [Day 2](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/workshop/day-2-recap.md)\\n\\n- [Day 3](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/workshop/day-3-recap.md).\\n\\n\\n## Simulation progress\\n\\n- **Haskell simulation**\\n  - Added support for dishonest nodes that diffuse an unbounded amount of old IBs, enabling further analysis of freshest-first and oldest-first vote delivery scenarios\\n  - Identified and fixed a bug in configuration generation for simulation runs, which was causing inconsistencies in vote delivery between default and uniform/extended voting schemes\\n  - Added an `adversarial` field to the network topology schema, allowing for the simulation of unbounded IB diffusion by dishonest nodes.\\n\\n## Ongoing investigations\\n\\n- Investigating the effects of unbounded IB diffusion on IB delivery reliability and protocol performance under such conditions\\n- Working on quantifying settlement times and their impact on protocol performance\\n- Exploring integration possibilities with Ouroboros Peras, mainly focusing on potentially reusing their voting mechanism to reduce resource consumption.\\n\\n## Additional resources\\n\\n- [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/discussions/243) \u2013 EB ledger states and \'history rewriting\' effects\\n- [The First Full Leios simulation analysis](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/analysis/sims/2025w13/analysis.ipynb) \u2013 detailed analysis of the latest simulation results."},{"id":"/2025/03/24/weekly-progress-summary","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2025/03/24/weekly-progress-summary","source":"@site/news/2025-03-24-weekly-progress-summary.md","title":"Weekly Summary \u2013 March 24, 2025","description":"This week, the Leios team continued working on various aspects of the protocol and its simulation capabilities.

The discussion was facilitated by [Denicio Bernier](https://x.com/DenicioBernier) and [Rick McCracken](https://x.com/RichardMcCrackn), and was meant to provide a broad overview of _Leios_, the protocol and the R&D project we have just started working on.\\n\\nWe first went through Pi\'s presentation, recalling how _Ouroboros Praos_ works in broad terms and the problem Leios provides a solution for, namely the low throughput of the network. This low throughput is a necessity imposed by diffusion delays across a world spanning network, and constraints of the stake-based sortition algorithm that\'s used to select block-forging leader. By deconnecting the data diffusion and validation process from the blockchain extension process, trading throughput for latency, Leios aims at dramatically increase the number of transactions that can be processed by Cardano.\\n\\nWe then took questions from the audience, detailing some aspects of the protocol, while answering expectations from the community like the expected throughput and availability of benchmarks, the anticipated timeline for Leios, its possible usage for transient data diffusion, and its relationship with other expected Ouroboros extensions like [Peras](https://peras.cardano-scaling.org).\\n\\n* Original [blog post](https://cardano.org/news/2024-06-14-media-understanding-leios-with-pi-lanningham-arnaud-bailly/) on Cardano.org\\n* [X/Twitter](https://x.com/Cardano/status/1802717851544915972) thread\\n* Discussion recording on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpXS9lgL6BA&t=3s)."}]}}')}}]);

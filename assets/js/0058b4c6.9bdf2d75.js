Integrating data on resource usage, including CPU, disk, and network bandwidth effectively connects theoretical throughput growth with the actual monthly expenses that stake pool operators incur.

These variables change according to feedback loops: higher transaction counts lead to increased fee revenue, but they also expand the ledger. Operators monitor when the cost of storing additional data exceeds the economic benefits of the increased fees. Graphs typically use colored lines or stacked areas to illustrate how each variable evolves over multiple epochs.","sidebar":"developmentSidebar"},"development/throughput-simulation":{"id":"development/throughput-simulation","title":"Throughput simulation","description":"The throughput simulator is an interactive tool demonstrating how varying transaction volumes, ledger storage, and stake pool costs can influence Cardano\u2019s future growth.

But how does it fare against heavyweights like Solana, Ethereum, and Bitcoin, especially for use cases like microtransactions, DeFi, or voting? We\u2019ve crafted a scorecard comparing these blockchains across seven key metrics - Throughput, Fee Predictability, Fee Loss Protection, Latency, Decentralization, Security, and Scalability. With a nod to Solana\u2019s user experience (UX) struggles around fee loss, let\u2019s see why Leios could shine."},"leios-cost-analysis":{"id":"leios-cost-analysis","title":"Understanding Leios - A Look at Cost Estimates for Cardano\u2019s Next Step","description":"At IOG, we\u2019re thrilled about the Leios project, a major leap toward enhancing Cardano\u2019s scalability and efficiency. During the April 2025 status meeting, we shared early cost estimates for running Leios nodes. Here\u2019s a straightforward breakdown of those figures, showing what it might cost to operate Leios compared to the current Praos protocol and the potential revenue from transaction fees."},"leios-use-cases":{"id":"leios-use-cases","title":"5 Game-Changing Use Cases Powered by Ouroboros Leios","description":"Cardano\u2019s on the cusp of a major upgrade with Ouroboros Leios, a protocol designed to turbocharge its scalability while keeping its decentralized roots intact. Leios could push Cardano from a modest 5\u201310 transactions per second (TPS) to an impressive 100 TPS, with sights set on 1,000+ TPS. This leap, paired with Cardano\u2019s focus on security, predictable fees, and 3,000 stake pools, opens doors to use cases that other blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana can\u2019t easily match. Let\u2019s dive into five exciting possibilities that Leios could make reality."},"resources":{"id":"resources","title":"Resources","description":"This page provides a collection of resources on Ouroboros Leios, including","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"roadmap":{"id":"roadmap","title":"Roadmap","description":"Leios is about maturing a consensus protocol design from a research paper","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"simple-explainer":{"id":"simple-explainer","title":"Leios - Making Cardano Faster and Ready for the Future","description":"If you\u2019re new to Cardano or curious about what\u2019s next for this blockchain, you might have heard the name Leios popping up.

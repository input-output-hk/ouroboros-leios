Integrating data on resource usage, including CPU, disk, and network bandwidth effectively connects theoretical throughput growth with the actual monthly expenses that stake pool operators incur.

These variables change according to feedback loops: higher transaction counts lead to increased fee revenue, but they also expand the ledger. Operators monitor when the cost of storing additional data exceeds the economic benefits of the increased fees.

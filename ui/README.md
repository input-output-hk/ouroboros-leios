# Rust Simulation UI - Web App

This UI web app is designed to read and display simulation traces generated by
the `sim-rs` project.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the UI, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - A fast JavaScript runtime.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Bun**

   Follow the instructions on the [Bun website](https://bun.sh/) to install Bun
   on your system.

2. **Generate a Trace**

   Before running the UI, you need to prepare a scenario for it to visualize. Add the following to a file named `public/scenarios.json`:

   ```json
   {
      "scenarios": [
         {
            "name": "My Scenario",
            "topology": "topologies/thousand.yaml",
            "duration": 30.0,
            "trace": "traces/myscenario.jsonl"
         }
      ]
   }
   ```

   Now add that topology to the public directory:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p public/topologies
   cp ../sim-rs/test-data/thousand.yaml public/topologies
   ```

   And generate a trace to visualize from the `sim-rs` directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ../ui/public/traces
   cargo run --release test_data/thousand.yaml ../ui/public/traces/myscenario.jsonl -s 30
   ```

3. **Run the UI**

   With Bun installed and the trace generated, navigate to the UI project
   directory and start the development server:

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

   This will launch the simulation in your browser.

## Additional Information

- Ensure that the path to the trace file (`output/messages.jsonl`) is correctly
  set in the UI project. This is typically defined in a utility file such as
  `ui/src/app/api/utils.ts`.

- If you encounter any issues, check the console for error messages and ensure
  all dependencies are correctly installed.

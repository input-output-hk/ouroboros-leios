# Rust Simulation UI - Web App

This UI web app is designed to read and display simulation traces generated by
the `sim-rs` project.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the UI, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - A fast JavaScript runtime.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Bun**

   Follow the instructions on the [Bun website](https://bun.sh/) to install Bun
   on your system.

2. **Generate a Trace**

   Before running the UI, you need to generate a trace using the `sim-rs`
   simulation. Navigate to the `sim-rs` directory and run the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo run --release test_data/thousand.yaml output/messages.jsonl -s 30
   ```

   This command will generate a trace file at `output/messages.jsonl`.

3. **Run the UI**

   With Bun installed and the trace generated, navigate to the UI project
   directory and start the development server:

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

   This will launch the simulation in your browser.

## Additional Information

- Ensure that the path to the trace file (`output/messages.jsonl`) is correctly
  set in the UI project. This is typically defined in a utility file such as
  `ui/src/app/api/utils.ts`.

- If you encounter any issues, check the console for error messages and ensure
  all dependencies are correctly installed.

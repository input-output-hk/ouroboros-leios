# DeltaQ / Statistics library for Ourobors Praos and Leios

The library provides a [∆Q](https://github.com/DeltaQ-SD/deltaq/) model for Linear Leios.

> [!CAUTION]
∆Q is [not built for modeling complex systems](https://github.com/DeltaQ-SD/deltaq/blob/main/doc/reports/artefact-A4.md#conclusion-and-next-steps).
Due to this restricution, running a complex model, like the one required for Linear Leios, is unfeasible. The issue is tracked here: https://github.com/DeltaQ-SD/deltaq/issues/134

## Running the code

Run the analysis and generate diagrams as follows:

```
$ cabal run leios-deltaq-analysis
```

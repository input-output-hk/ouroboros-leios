# Glossary

- **Input Block (IB)**: A block that contains transactions and is produced by
  nodes that win the IB sortition lottery.

- **Endorser Block (EB)**: A block that references IBs and is produced by nodes
  that win the EB sortition lottery.

- **Ranking Block (RB)**: A block that ranks other blocks and is part of the
  consensus mechanism.

- **BLS**: Boneh-Lynn-Shacham, a cryptographic signature scheme that allows for
  efficient aggregation of signatures.

- **ALBA**: A cryptographic protocol or component used within the Leios
  framework.

- **Musen**: Another cryptographic protocol or component used within the Leios
  framework.

- **Sortition**: A probabilistic method for selecting nodes to perform certain
  roles, based on their stake.

- **VRF**: Verifiable Random Function, a cryptographic function that produces a
  random output that can be verified.

- **Stake**: The amount of cryptocurrency held by a node, which influences its
  probability of being selected in sortition.

- **Lovelace**: The smallest unit of the Cardano cryptocurrency, named after Ada
  Lovelace.

- **Praos**: A version of the Ouroboros consensus protocol that Leios builds
  upon.

- **Mithril**: A protocol or component related to voting or cryptographic proofs
  in the Leios framework.

- **Pipeline**: A sequence of stages in the Leios protocol where different types
  of blocks are produced and processed.

- **Certificate**: A cryptographic proof that attests to the validity of certain
  blocks or transactions.

- **Quorum**: The minimum number of votes required to certify a block or
  decision.

- **Epoch**: A fixed period in the blockchain during which certain processes or
  calculations are performed.

- **Decentralization Parameter**: A measure of how distributed the control of
  the network is among its participants.

- **Throughput**: The rate at which transactions are processed by the network.

- **Latency**: The delay between the submission of a transaction and its
  confirmation on the blockchain.

- **Bandwidth**: The amount of data that can be transmitted over the network in
  a given time period.

- **Compression**: The process of reducing the size of data to save storage
  space or transmission time.

- **Sharding**: A method of partitioning data to improve scalability and
  performance.

- **Equivocation**: The act of producing conflicting blocks or messages in a
  blockchain network.

- **Freshest First**: A policy for prioritizing newer blocks or transactions
  over older ones.

# Leios - Making Cardano Faster and Ready for the Future

If you’re new to Cardano or curious about what’s next for this blockchain, you might have heard the name *Leios* popping up. Don’t worry if it sounds technical—Leios is a project that’s all about making Cardano faster, stronger, and ready for more people to use. Let’s break it down in a simple way!

## What is Leios?

Leios is a new idea from IOG (the team behind Cardano) to help Cardano handle way more transactions at once. Right now, Cardano processes about 3.5 transactions per second (TPS). That’s like a small highway with a few cars moving smoothly. Leios is like adding tons of new lanes, letting thousands of cars (or transactions) zoom through—up to 2,100 TPS or more! This means apps like online games, finance tools, or NFT marketplaces can run faster and serve more people.

## Why Does This Matter?

A faster Cardano means more possibilities for everyone. Imagine:
- **Shoppers** buying digital art or tickets without waiting.
- **App creators** building cool new tools that work smoothly for millions.
- **Communities** using Cardano for things like voting or charity projects.

Leios makes Cardano a bigger playground for ideas, whether you’re a user, a developer, or just a fan of the blockchain world.

## How Much Will It Cost?

Running the computers (called nodes) that keep Cardano going costs money. The Leios team shared some early estimates:
- Today, nodes are affordable, costing $15–$114 a month, depending on where they’re hosted (like using budget-friendly Hetzner or pricier Amazon Web Services).
- Even as Leios ramps up to handle thousands of transactions, costs stay reasonable for most operators.

Plus, Leios could bring in enough money from transaction fees to keep the network running strong. For example, at 3.5 TPS, it could earn nearly 2 million ADA (Cardano’s currency) a month. At 2,100 TPS, that jumps to over a billion ADA! This helps Cardano stay sustainable for years to come.

## What’s Next for Leios?

Leios is still in the research phase, so these numbers are early guesses. The team is working hard to make it even more efficient. If you’re excited about Cardano’s future, you can follow along on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/) to see the latest updates or join the Cardano community to share your ideas.

Leios is about building a Cardano that’s fast, affordable, and open to everyone. Whether you’re new to blockchain or a longtime fan, this project is something to watch—it’s paving the way for a bigger, better Cardano!

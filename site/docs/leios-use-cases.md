# 5 Game-Changing Use Cases Powered by Ouroboros Leios

Cardano’s on the cusp of a major upgrade with *Ouroboros Leios*, a protocol designed to turbocharge its scalability while keeping its decentralized roots intact. Leios could push Cardano from a modest 5–10 transactions per second (TPS) to an impressive 100 TPS, with sights set on 1,000+ TPS. This leap, paired with Cardano’s focus on security, predictable fees, and 3,000 stake pools, opens doors to use cases that other blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana can’t easily match. Let’s dive into five exciting possibilities that Leios could make reality.

## 1. Global Microtransaction Ecosystems

Imagine tipping a content creator in Africa a few cents for a blog post, paying a smart lock in Europe a nickel to unlock, or buying in-game items in Asia—all instantly, with fees so low they’re barely noticeable. Leios makes this global microtransaction economy possible.

- **Why Leios Shines** - Leios’ 100–1,000 TPS can handle millions of tiny payments daily (think 8.6 million transactions a day at 100 TPS). Its high throughput could slash fees below the current ~0.34 ADA, making microtransactions economical. Plus, Leios’ partial transaction determinism—where you pay predictable fees or slightly more in rare conflicts—ensures you’re not stung by surprise costs, unlike Ethereum’s $1–$10 gas fees during busy times.
- **Why Others Fall Short** - Bitcoin’s 7 TPS and $1–$5 fees are too slow and costly for microtransactions. Ethereum’s 15–30 TPS and fee volatility make low-value payments risky. Solana’s 65,000 TPS is fast but relies on a centralized validator set, risking censorship for global users.
- **Real-World Vision** - A decentralized streaming platform where fans tip creators 0.05 ADA per view, processed instantly for thousands, without a middleman or fee spikes.

## 2. Decentralized Supply Chain Tracking

From farm to table or factory to pharmacy, tracking goods like food or vaccines across global supply chains demands speed, trust, and transparency. Leios could make Cardano the go-to blockchain for this.

- **Why Leios Shines** - Supply chains generate thousands of updates daily (e.g., IoT sensor pings, shipping scans). Leios’ 100 TPS can handle this volume, unlike the current Cardano’s 10 TPS, which risks delays. Its elastic capacity ensures updates flow even during peak loads, vital for time-sensitive goods. With 3,000 stake pools, Cardano resists tampering, ensuring audit-ready records without a central authority.
- **Why Others Fall Short** - Ethereum’s high fees and congestion make frequent updates pricey. Bitcoin’s low throughput can’t keep up with real-time tracking. Solana’s speed is offset by centralization risks, undermining trust for audits.
- **Real-World Vision** - A pharmaceutical company tracks vaccine batches globally, recording each scan on-chain. Regulators verify every step, confident in Cardano’s tamper-proof, decentralized ledger.

## 3. Mass-Scale DeFi with Time-Sensitive Transactions

Decentralized finance (DeFi) thrives on speed—think liquidating a loan to avoid losses or snagging an arbitrage deal. Leios could make Cardano a DeFi powerhouse by handling thousands of users without hiccups.

- **Why Leios Shines** - Leios’ elastic capacity prevents the congestion that bogs down Cardano today, ensuring time-sensitive transactions (e.g., liquidations) execute in ~3–5 minutes. Its partial determinism means predictable fees (or slightly higher in conflicts, like 1–2 ADA), avoiding Ethereum’s $10–$100 failed transaction costs. Cardano’s decentralized stake pools ensure fair access, unlike Solana’s concentrated validators.
- **Why Others Fall Short** - Ethereum’s delays and fee spikes during DeFi surges (like 2021’s gas wars) frustrate users. Solana’s speed comes with centralization risks, eroding trust. Bitcoin lacks DeFi-capable smart contracts.
- **Real-World Vision** - A Cardano-based DEX like SundaeSwap processes 1,000 trades per second during a market crash, with liquidations finalized fast, keeping users in control.

## 4. Decentralized Identity for Large Populations

Imagine giving millions in developing nations secure, self-sovereign digital IDs for voting, healthcare, or education. Leios could supercharge Cardano’s Atala PRISM to manage identities at population scale.

- **Why Leios Shines** - Leios’ 100 TPS can support millions of daily identity updates (e.g., credential issuance, verifications), far beyond Praos’ 10 TPS. Lower fees make frequent updates affordable, unlike Ethereum’s costly gas. Cardano’s decentralization ensures no single entity controls sensitive data, a must for trust in identity systems.
- **Why Others Fall Short** - Ethereum’s fees and throughput limit mass adoption. Bitcoin lacks smart contract flexibility. Solana’s centralization risks data control by a few validators, problematic for sovereign IDs.
- **Real-World Vision** - A government issues digital IDs to 10 million citizens, with daily verifications for healthcare or voting recorded on-chain, secure and low-cost.

## 5. Real-Time Voting Systems

From national elections to Cardano’s own governance votes (like CIPs), secure, transparent voting needs speed and trust. Leios could make Cardano the backbone for real-time, tamper-proof voting.

- **Why Leios Shines** - Leios’ 100 TPS can handle thousands of votes per second (8.6 million daily), enabling instant results for millions, unlike Praos’ slower pace. Its censorship resistance ensures votes aren’t delayed during high turnout. Stake-based voting (used in Leios’ Endorsement Blocks) guarantees tamper-proof outcomes, unlike centralized systems.
- **Why Others Fall Short** - Ethereum’s congestion slows vote processing during peaks. Bitcoin’s throughput can’t scale. Solana’s centralization risks vote manipulation by validators.
- **Real-World Vision** - Cardano’s DReps cast millions of governance votes in real-time, finalized in ~3–5 minutes, ensuring a transparent, secure process.

## Why Leios Stands Out

Leios isn’t just about speed—it’s about balancing scale, reliability, and trust. Its 100–1,000 TPS lets thousands of apps coexist without clogging up, unlike Ethereum’s congestion or Bitcoin’s limits. Its elastic capacity handles spikes, perfect for time-sensitive DeFi or voting. Cardano’s 3,000 stake pools keep it decentralized, unlike Solana’s validator risks. And its partial determinism—where fees stay mostly predictable—beats Ethereum’s fee volatility, making microtransactions or identity updates user-friendly.

## The Road Ahead

Leios is still in R&D, with simulations and testnets on the horizon, as π Lanningham notes. Its success hinges on adoption—businesses and developers must build on Cardano’s new capacity. Challenges like transaction conflicts (e.g., double-spending risks) are being tackled with solutions like collateralization or pre-validation certificates, ensuring reliability. If Cardano’s community—stake pool operators, DReps, and you—embraces Leios, these use cases could redefine what blockchains can do.

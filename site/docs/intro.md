# What is Leios?

:::warning

This web site and the Leios R&D project are in their very early stage. More details will be added in the forthcoming weeks and months.

:::

_Ouroboros Leios_ is a novel protocol extending [Ouroboros Praos](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/ouroboros-overview/) that aims at dramatically increase the _throughput_ of Cardano network. The core protocol and its theoretical properties are defined in [this research paper](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/high-throughput-blockchain-consensus-under-realistic-network-assumptions/).

## In a nutshell

_Leios_ is based on the key idea of _input endorsers_. Whereas in a classical blockchain, the blocks' body directly contains transactions, in Leios the blocks' body can also contain references to _Endorser blocks_ which themselves contain references to so-called _Input blocks_ containing the actual transactions. Those references are _certified_ through a voting mechanism that guarantees a majority of validators agree on the content of _Endorser blocks_.

By decoupling the logic of validating blocks' payload and extending the blockchain, and limiting the work needed to verify the chain, much higher throughput can be achieved and new use cases can be unlocked.

More documentation about Leios can be found in the following sources:

* The [Leios CIP](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/379) by Duncan Coutts, providing rationale and a high-level design of the protocol
* The original [Research paper](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/high-throughput-blockchain-consensus-under-realistic-network-assumptions/) is of course the main reference _north star_
* [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czmg9WmSCcI) from Pr. Aggelos Kiayias, IOG's Chief Scientist, explains Leios in the context of _Scaling Cardano_
* One of the paper's co-author, Giorgos Panagiotakos, has shot a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEcYVygdhzU) explaining Leios
* [These slides ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W_KHdvdLNDEStE99D7Af2SRiTqZNnVLQiEPqRHJySqI/edit?usp=sharing) from Sandro Coretti-Drayton, another researcher that worked on Leios might also help getting a good intuition about Leios

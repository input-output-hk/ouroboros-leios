## Leios Comparisons and Analyses

- [Leios Scorecard Comparison](leios-comparison.md) – How does Cardano’s Ouroboros Leios stack up against Solana, Ethereum, and Bitcoin? This scorecard compares throughput, fees, decentralization, and more.

- [Leios Use Cases](leios-use-cases.md) – Discover how Ouroboros Leios, Cardano’s next-gen protocol, could enable unique use cases like global microtransactions, supply chain tracking, and more, outshining other blockchains.

- [Leios Node Cost Analysis](leios-cost-analysis.md) – During the April 2025 status meeting, we shared early cost estimates for running Leios nodes. Here’s a straightforward breakdown of those figures, showing what it might cost to operate Leios compared to the current Praos protocol and the potential revenue from transaction fees.

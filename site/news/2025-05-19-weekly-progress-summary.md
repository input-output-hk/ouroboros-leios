This week, the Leios team focused on improving simulation capabilities, enhancing transaction processing, and expanding the test coverage. The team made significant progress in addressing transaction inclusion rates and developing a comprehensive conformance testing framework.

## Simulation improvements

### Rust simulation
- Investigated and addressed poor transaction inclusion rates
- Implemented "late IB inclusion" extension to Full Leios, significantly improving transaction ledger inclusion odds
- Identified and addressed issues with non-sharded input transactions causing excessive duplication
- Made several key enhancements:
  - Enabled late IB inclusion by default
  - Fixed off-by-one error in late IB inclusion logic
  - Added `praos-fallback-enabled` setting for throughput investigation
  - Improved transaction deduplication in Praos blocks.

## Testing framework

### Conformance testing
- Developed comprehensive catalog of [Potential Conformance Tests](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/leios-trace-verifier/conformance-coverage.md)
- Implemented property-based testing suite for trace verification
- Added both positive and negative test cases covering:
  - Genesis slot operations
  - Block production (RB, IB, EB)
  - Vote generation
  - Various production patterns (sporadic, noisy)
  - Invalid scenarios (equivocation, gaps)
- Successfully verified golden traces against Agda specification.

## Documentation

### Formal specification
- Launched comprehensive web-based documentation for the Ouroboros Leios formal specification at [leios.cardano-scaling.org/formal-spec](https://leios.cardano-scaling.org/formal-spec/)
- Enhanced documentation features:
  - Interactive exploration of Leios modules
  - Type linking between related components
  - Full text search capabilities
  - Improved accessibility of formal specification details.

## Transaction lifecycle analysis

- Conducted detailed analysis of transaction processing efficiency
- Generated cumulative probability model for transaction ledger inclusion
- Analyzed relationship between IB production rate and stage length
- Created visualization of [transaction-to-block inclusion probabilities](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/analysis/tx-to-block-cum-slots-fig.svg).

## Next steps

- Continue monitoring and optimizing transaction inclusion rates
- Expand conformance test coverage as Agda specification evolves
- Further investigate transaction sharding strategies
- Refine transaction lifecycle model based on simulation results.

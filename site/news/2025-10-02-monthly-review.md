Watch our September 2025 monthly review livestream covering the latest progress on Leios as the project is getting handed over from IOR to IOE. This month we cover a summary of the CIP-164 reception, early prototyping by Blink Labs, the impact analysis report we had been writing and a look on the roadmap on our journey to a public Leios testnet.

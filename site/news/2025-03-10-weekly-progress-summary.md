This week, the Leios team made significant progress in simulation capabilities, with a successful comparison of Rust and Haskell simulations across [**90 scenarios**](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/analysis/sims/2025w11/analysis.ipynb). A [**mainnet-scale analysis**](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/analysis/sims/2025w11xl/analysis.ipynb) of Leios on a [**realistic 3,000-node network**](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/leios-2025w11/sim-rs/test_data/realistic.yaml) revealed unexpected performance benefits from network topology. Insights from [**sharding performance analysis**](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/analysis/shard-performance.ipynb) provided important optimization strategies. Finally, the team refined both simulation implementations for greater realism and comparability, while the formal methods team developed initial trace verification tools for Short Leios.

## Simulation comparison

- Compared [90 scenarios](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/analysis/sims/2025w11/analysis.ipynb) between Rust and Haskell simulations at tag [`leios-2025w11`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/releases/tag/leios-2025w11)
- Recent fixes and adjustments enabled meaningful comparison between simulations
- Identified [issues](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aquestion) requiring further investigation.

### Analysis of mainnet-scale simulation

- Completed the first [analysis](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/analysis/sims/2025w11xl/analysis.ipynb) of Leios on a mainnet-scale network simulation using the Rust simulator
- Discovered that a 3,000-node mainnet-scale network transports IBs faster than an artificial 100-node network
- Identified 'shortcut' edges in larger networks as a likely factor in the improved transport speed.

### Performance analysis of sharding

- Created [computational models](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/analysis/shard-performance.ipynb) to analyze the relationship between the fraction of shards without an IB and the expected number of extra IBs
- Evaluated performance characteristics of the simplest sharding scheme.

## Haskell simulation

- Fixed a bug in the relay protocol that prevented full diffusion of votes
- Adjusted the priority of certified EBs for inclusion in RBs
- Added support for an output log format that shares a common subset with the Rust simulator
- Analyzed TCP realism in comparison to idealized diffusion:
  - Discovered that higher IB rates and sizes improve diffusion times
  - Identified ledger state access as a significant source of latency.

## Rust simulation

- Expanded logs to include total IB size and parent ID of RBs
- Implemented the same EB selection strategy as in the Haskell simulation
- Added validation of IB headers before propagation to neighbors
- Investigating lower congestion in the Rust simulation compared to Haskell.

## Formal methods

- Developed the initial trace verifier for Short Leios simulation traces in `leios-trace-verifier`.

## Research

- Progressing on ledger design by exploring options and trade-offs
- Analyzing how concurrent input blocks in Leios create unique ledger-level challenges not present in Praos
- Evaluating approaches that balance multiple properties, including:
  - Conflict avoidance in the blockchain
  - Guaranteed fee payment for block producers
  - Transaction eligibility and inclusion speed
  - User experience regarding fee payment
- Investigating sharding-based solutions with various optimization strategies
- Planning to share more detailed findings at Leios public meeting by the end of March
- Targeting a comprehensive recommendation for implementors by the end of April.

### From Short Leios to Full Leios

- Planning the simulation roadmap for transitioning from Short Leios (currently implemented) to Full Leios
- Developing implementation guidelines for simulators to incorporate the pipeline referencing scheme specified in the papers
- Identifying key components needed to simulate the complete ledger inclusion guarantees of Full Leios.

This repository is home of the _Leios R&D project_ whose purpose is to define a specification of the Ouroboros Leios protocol.

# Getting started

Checkout [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document for possible contributions and communication channels

More documentation about Leios can be found in various sources:

* The [Leios CIP](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/379) providing rationale and high-level design of the protocol
* The original [Research paper](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/high-throughput-blockchain-consensus-under-realistic-network-assumptions/) is of course the _north star_ of this project
* One of the paper's co-author, Giorgos Panagiotakos, has shot a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEcYVygdhzU) explaining Leios
* [These slides ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W_KHdvdLNDEStE99D7Af2SRiTqZNnVLQiEPqRHJySqI/edit?usp=sharing) from Sandro Coretti-Drayton, another researcher that worked on Leios might also help getting a good intuition about Leios

# Content

## Project progress

The [Logbook](Logbook.md) contains a detailed account of problems,
successes, failures, ideas, references and is intended as a tool to
help the team members stay in sync. It's updated frequently with notes
about the day-to-day work, meetings, ideas, etc.

## Archive

The [Leios CIP](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/379)
initially proposed in November 2022, yielded the following
content. While the material there is still relevant and useful, it
won't be updated in the future.

* `report`: the LaTeX source for the design report
* `CIP`: the initial version of the Leios CIP
* `simulation`: simulation and visualisation code for investigating Leios-like network traffic patterns.

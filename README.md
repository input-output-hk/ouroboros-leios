## Archive

The [Leios CIP](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/379)
initially proposed in November 2022, yielded the following
content. While the material there is still relevant and useful, it
won't be updated in the future.

* `report`: the LaTeX source for the design report
* `CIP`: the initial version of the Leios CIP
* `simulation`: simulation and visualisation code for investigating Leios-like network traffic patterns.

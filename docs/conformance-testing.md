# Conformance testing

The goal of conformance testing is to check that an implementation of a protocol behaves as described in the formal specification of the protocol, i.e. conformance testing verifies that a given trace from an execution of the protocol is one of the possible paths defined by a relation in the formal specification.

## Formal specification

The formal specification of [Ouroboros Leios](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios-formal-spec) is implemented in Agda as a relational specification. Different variants of the Leios protocol have been explored in the formal specification, with a focus on Short-Leios.
A common code base for the variants is used in order to share data types, like the block types for example.
The functionalities (FFD, VRF, Base ledger, etc.) are abstract data types with defining properties.

### Categorical crypto framework

Motivated by the need for better runtime performance of the trace verifier, the Categorical Crypto Framework developed by Andr√© Knispel has been introduced in the project. The framework facilitates the composition of the different components and we no longer have to manage the state of the functionalities explicitly (previously state of the functionalities was also put into the `LeiosState` for convenience).

### Single node view

The formal spec describes the evolution of a single, honest node running the Leios protocol, i.e., it describes all the possible changes of the `LeiosState` with given pre-conditions.
This is different to the formal specifications of [Ouroboros Peras](https://github.com/input-output-hk/peras-design/blob/main/src/Peras/SmallStep.lagda.md) or [Ouroboros Praos](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-praos-formal-spec/blob/main/src/Protocol/Semantics.agda), where in both cases all nodes of the distributed system, including adversarial nodes, are modelled and the relation in the formal specification describes the possible evolution of the distributed system as a whole.

### State transitions in Leios

The Short-Leios relation does the following state transition steps:

* Creating an InputBlock
* Creating an EndorserBlock
* Voting
* Not elected to create an InputBlock
* Not elected to create an EndorserBlock
* Not elected to vote
* Transitioning to the next slot
* Interaction with Base Ledger

A state transition step usually has pre-conditions that need to be fulfilled. For details, see [(Full-)Short Leios transitions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios-formal-spec/blob/main/formal-spec/Leios/Short.lagda.md#full-short-leios-transitions) in the formal specification.

## Trace verification

Trace verification checks, if an execution trace of the Leios protocol is possible with respect to the formal specification. The idea has been developed in the [formal-streamlet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/formal-streamlet) protocol and been adapted in the [Fast-BFT](https://github.com/input-output-hk/innovation-fastbft) and Leios projects. Trace verification in the Leios project is currently implemented for Short-Leios.

When parsing a trace log file, events are mapped to actions that trigger a step in the relational specification. As long as for an action the pre-conditions for the next transition step can be fulfilled and the step can be done, the transition is considered correct with respect to the formal specification. Steps are done sequentially until a transition fails with a proof providing of the reason of failure that gets included in the error message.

### Error handling

Error handling is the interpretation of the failure proofs, mapping the failure proofs to informative error messages that can be displayed in the output of the trace verifier.

### Conformance events

For conformance testing additional events had to be added to the Haskell and Rust simulation. First, an explicit event for the slot transition of node has been added (the event could as be inferred from the other log entries), second the "negative" election for block creation or voting events have been added as well. Those "negative" events are needed as the formal specification enforces a node to check, whether a block or vote can be created.

### Formal spec repo

The formal specification of the Leios protocol is implemented in the repository [ouroboros-leios-formal-spec](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios-formal-spec).
In that repository there are [examples](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios-formal-spec/blob/main/formal-spec/Leios/Short/Trace/Verifier/Test.lagda.md) that illustrate how the trace verifier works. The sample trace is part of the example in the Agda file. In addition in order to setup the trace verifier we need the following configuration values:

* Stake distribution
* Configuration
* Parameters

### Leios repo

In the `leios-trace-verifier` module in the Leios repo the executable for the trace verifier is built. This is done by extracting the Agda code as MAlonzo to Haskell. Having the Haskell code for the trace verifier also to use it together with log file parser from the module `leios-trace-hs`. The Haskell module is a shared module that both the Haskell simulation code and the trace verifier use. 

In addition there is a common trace log file format specified in JSON, that both the Haskell and Rust simulation use when externalizing events into the trace log file.

```bash
{"message":{"id":"0-0","pipeline":0,"producer":"node-0","rb_ref":"genesis","size_bytes":98608,"slot":0,"tx_payload_bytes":98304,"type":"IBGenerated"},"time_s":0.13}
{"message":{"id":"1-0","pipeline":0,"producer":"node-1","rb_ref":"genesis","size_bytes":98608,"slot":0,"tx_payload_bytes":98304,"type":"IBGenerated"},"time_s":0.13}
{"message":{"id":"2-0","pipeline":0,"producer":"node-2","rb_ref":"genesis","size_bytes":98608,"slot":0,"tx_payload_bytes":98304,"type":"IBGenerated"},"time_s":0.13}
```

* buildup stake distr
* read topo file, etc.

### Running the trace verifier

Example execution

#### Generate a trace file

Currently both simulations, Rust and Haskell, support generating the additional events needed for conformance testing by adding the flag `--conformance-testing` when running the simulation from the command line.

```bash
$ cargo run --release -- --slots 86400 --conformance-events ../leios-trace-verifier/examples/topology.yaml ../sim-rs.out
```

### Run trace verifier

It is recommended to run trace verifier using Nix and with the Haskell runtime system parameters setting the minimal heap size.

#### flags

```bash
$ nix run .#leios-trace-verifier -- +RTS -H1G -s -RTS --help

#### Performance

GC degrades for long traces

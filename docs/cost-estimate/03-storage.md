## Ouroboros Praos

We start with Ouroboros Praos to establish a baseline for storage requirements.
In Praos, storage is primarily used for maintaining the blockchain history.

### Block Components

| Component       | Size (bytes) | Size (KiB) |
| --------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Block header    | 1,024        | 1          |
| Block body      | 90,112       | 88         |
| **Total block** | **91,136**   | **89**     |

### Block Production Rate

| Parameter               | Value    | Formula            |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| Slot duration           | 1 second | Protocol parameter |
| Active slot coefficient | 0.05     | Protocol parameter |
| **Blocks per second**   | **0.05** | $$1 \times 0.05$$  |

### Monthly Storage Formula

$$S_{\text{monthly}} = B_{\text{size}} \times R_{\text{block}} \times T_{\text{month}}$$

where:

- $S_{\text{monthly}}$ = Monthly storage requirement in bytes
- $B_{\text{size}}$ = Size of each block in bytes
- $R_{\text{block}}$ = Block production rate (blocks per second)
- $T_{\text{month}}$ = Number of seconds in a month (30.4167 days = 2,628,000 seconds)

### Monthly Storage Calculation

$$S_{\text{monthly}} = 91,136 \times 0.05 \times 2,628,000$$

$$S_{\text{monthly}} = 11,973,196,800 \text{ bytes} \approx 11.15 \text{ GiB}$$

### Ledger State

In addition to the blockchain history, nodes must maintain:

- Current approximate size: 200 GiB (as of April 2025)
- Growth rate depends on transaction volume

## Ouroboros Leios

Leios introduces multiple block types that contribute to the overall storage
requirements.

### Block Size Components

| Component                      | Size (bytes) | Size (KiB) |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| Input Block (IB) Header        | 304          | 0.3        |
| Input Block (IB) Body          | 98,304       | 96         |
| **Total IB**                   | **98,608**   | **96.3**   |
| Endorsement Block (EB) Header  | 240          | 0.2        |
| EB Body (per IB reference)     | 32           | 0.03       |
| Ranking Block (RB) Header      | 1,024        | 1          |
| Ranking Block (RB) Certificate | 7,168        | 7          |
| **Total RB**                   | **8,192**    | **8**      |

> [!NOTE]
> The RB body in Leios contains exactly one certificate of size 7,168 bytes, not
> the full 88 KiB as in Praos blocks.

### Time and Rate Parameters

| Parameter         | Value                 | Formula/Source                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Stage length      | 20 slots (20 seconds) | Protocol parameter                        |
| EBs per stage     | 1.5                   | Protocol parameter                        |
| Votes per EB      | 600                   | Protocol parameter                        |
| RBs per stage     | 1                     | Protocol parameter                        |
| Days per month    | 30.4167               | $$\frac{365}{12}$$                        |
| Seconds per month | 2,628,000             | $$30.4167 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60$$ |
| Stages per month  | 131,400               | $$\frac{2,628,000}{20}$$                  |

> [!Note]
> Votes are ephemeral and don't require permanent storage, so they are
> excluded from the storage calculations.

### Storage Formulas

1. **IB Storage**: $$S_{\text{IB}} = R_{\text{IB}} \times T_{\text{month}} \times \text{Size}_{\text{IB}}$$
   where:
   - $R_{\text{IB}}$ = Input Block rate (IB/s)
   - $T_{\text{month}}$ = Number of seconds in a month (2,628,000)
   - $\text{Size}_{\text{IB}}$ = Size of each IB in bytes (98,608)

2. **EB Storage**:
   $$S_{EB} = N_{EB\_stage} \times N_{stages} \times (Size_{EB\_header} + Size_{EB\_body} \times N_{IB\_refs})$$
   where:
   - $N_{EB\_stage}$ = Number of EBs per stage (1.5)
   - $N_{stages}$ = Number of stages per month (131,400)
   - $Size_{EB\_header}$ = EB header size (240 bytes)
   - $Size_{EB\_body}$ = EB body size per reference (32 bytes)
   - $N_{IB\_refs}$ = Number of IB references per EB (varies by IB rate)

3. **RB Storage**: $$S_{\text{RB}} = N_{\text{RB\_stage}} \times N_{\text{stages}} \times \text{Size}_{\text{RB}}$$
   where:
   - $N_{\text{RB\_stage}}$ = Number of RBs per stage (1)
   - $N_{\text{stages}}$ = Number of stages per month (131,400)
   - $\text{Size}_{\text{RB}}$ = Size of each RB (8,192 bytes = header + certificate)

4. **Total Chain State Storage**: $$S_{\text{total}} = S_{\text{IB}} + S_{\text{EB}} + S_{\text{RB}}$$

### Storage Calculation (0.05 IB/s)

For a fair comparison, we calculate Leios storage at the same transaction
throughput as Praos (0.05 blocks or IBs per second):

1. **IB Storage**:
   $$S_{\text{IB}} = 0.05 \times 2,628,000 \times 98,608 = 12,957,091,200 \text{ bytes} \approx 12.07 \text{ GiB}$$

2. **EB Storage**: At 0.05 IB/s and 20-second stages, each EB contains
   references to approximately 1 IB:
   $$S_{\text{EB}} = 1.5 \times 131,400 \times (240 + 32 \times 1) = 53,690,400 \text{ bytes} \approx 0.05 \text{ GiB}$$

3. **RB Storage**:
   $$S_{\text{RB}} = 1 \times 131,400 \times 8,192 = 1,076,428,800 \text{ bytes} \approx 1.00 \text{ GiB}$$

4. **Total Storage**: $$S_{\text{total}} = 12.07 + 0.05 + 1.00 = 13.12 \text{ GiB}$$

### Storage Component Analysis (at 0.05 IB/s)

| Component | Storage Size | % of Total Chain State |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| IB        | 12.07 GiB    | 92.0%                  |
| EB        | 0.05 GiB     | 0.4%                   |
| RB        | 1.00 GiB     | 7.6%                   |

At the baseline rate, Input Blocks dominate the storage requirements (92.0%),
with Ranking Blocks contributing a smaller portion, and Endorsement Blocks
having minimal impact.

### Monthly Storage at Higher IB Rates

| IB/s | IB Storage   | EB Storage | RB Storage | Total Storage | vs Praos |
| ---- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------- |
| 0.05 | 12.07 GiB    | 0.05 GiB   | 1.00 GiB   | 13.12 GiB     | +18%     |
| 1    | 241.40 GiB   | 0.10 GiB   | 1.00 GiB   | 242.50 GiB    | +2,075%  |
| 5    | 1,207.01 GiB | 0.25 GiB   | 1.00 GiB   | 1,208.26 GiB  | +10,737% |
| 10   | 2,414.02 GiB | 0.45 GiB   | 1.00 GiB   | 2,415.47 GiB  | +21,563% |
| 20   | 4,828.04 GiB | 0.85 GiB   | 1.00 GiB   | 4,829.89 GiB  | +43,217% |
| 30   | 7,242.06 GiB | 1.25 GiB   | 1.00 GiB   | 7,244.31 GiB  | +64,872% |

> [!Note]

### Storage Component Analysis at Higher IB Rates

As the IB rate increases, the storage profile changes dramatically:

| IB/s | IB Storage % | EB Storage % | RB Storage % |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| 0.05 | 92.0%        | 0.4%         | 7.6%         |
| 1    | 99.5%        | <0.1%        | 0.4%         |
| 5    | 99.9%        | <0.1%        | <0.1%        |
| 10   | >99.9%       | <0.1%        | <0.1%        |
| 20   | >99.9%       | <0.1%        | <0.1%        |
| 30   | >99.9%       | <0.1%        | <0.1%        |

This shows that as throughput increases, Input Block storage completely
dominates the requirements, comprising over 99% of storage at rates above 1
IB/s.

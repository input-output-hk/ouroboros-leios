# Leios Consensus Upgrade - Threat Model

A threat model for the Linear Leios consensus change for Cardano. This reflects the simplified "Linear Leios" variant described in the CIP draft, which eliminates Input Blocks (IBs) and produces Endorser Blocks (EBs) alongside Ranking Blocks (RBs) by the same block producer.

See also [the threat model section in Leios Technical Report #1](./technical-report-1.md#threat-model) and more [comments on attack surface in Leios Technical Report #2](./technical-report-2.md#notes-on-the-leios-attack-surface).

## System Overview

### Description

Leios is an overlay protocol on top of Ouroboros Praos that enhances transaction throughput by allowing block producers to create larger Endorser Blocks (EBs) alongside standard Praos blocks (enhanced as Ranking Blocks - RBs). The system maintains backward compatibility while introducing new responsibilities for stake pools.

### Key Components

#### Entities

- **Mempool**: List of valid, pending transactions that could be added to the chain. Expanded capacity to support both RB and EB production
- **Ranking Block (RB)**: Standard Praos block enhanced with Leios certificate and EB announcement fields. Limited to current mainnet size (~88 kB)
- **Endorser Block (EB)**: New block type that references transactions for inclusion. May be substantially larger (~640 kB for 20k transaction references)
- **Leios Certificate**: Cryptographic proof about aggregated stake-weighted votes on EB validity and transaction availability

#### Network Protocols
- **Transaction Submission Protocol**: Existing protocol, unchanged except for expanded mempool capacity, served upstream
- **Chain Sync Protocol**: Existing protocol for tracking block headers of currently selected chain, served downstream
- **Block Fetch Protocol**: Existing protocol for downloading blocks, served downstream
- **EB Announcement Protocol**: New protocol to gossip EB existence, served downstream
- **EB Fetch Protocol**: New protocol for retrieving EBs on-demand, served downstream
- **Transaction Fetch Protocol**: New protocol for retrieving transactions referenced by EBs, served downstream
- **Vote Diffusion Protocol**: New protocol for propagating votes on EBs, served downstream

#### Roles
- **Block Producers**: Produce RBs and simultaneously create EBs, participate in voting
- **Relays**: Participate in transaction, block, and vote diffusion
- **Clients**: Submit transactions and observe ledger state, maintain backward compatibility

#### System Flow
1. **Block Production**: When eligible, stake pools simultaneously create an RB (announcing an EB) and the corresponding EB
2. **EB Distribution**: EBs are discovered via RB headers and fetched by nodes
3. **Committee Validation**: Selected voting committee validates EBs
4. **Certification**: EBs achieving quorum (>60% voting stake) become certified
5. **Chain Inclusion**: Certificates are included in subsequent RBs, making referenced transactions part of the ledger

See also the [CIP draft](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/pull/396) for a more detailed specification.

## Assets to Protect

For each asset we define what could be impacted in respect to its Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability; i.e. the [CIA Triad](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/cia-triad-confidentiality-integrity-availability.html)

### A1: Blockchain Safety
**Description**: The fundamental guarantee that all honest nodes agree on the blockchain history and no conflicting valid chains exist.

**CIA Impact:**
- **Confidentiality**: Not applicable - blockchain is public
- **Integrity**: CRITICAL - Chain splits or conflicting histories would break consensus
- **Availability**: HIGH - Safety failures could halt the network indefinitely

**Leios-Specific Considerations**: Vote certificates and EB validation must not create conflicting blockchain states or enable double-spending.

### A2: Blockchain Liveness
**Description**: The guarantee that the blockchain continues to make progress by producing new blocks and processing transactions within reasonable time bounds.

**CIA Impact:**
- **Confidentiality**: Not applicable - blockchain is public
- **Integrity**: MEDIUM - Liveness failures don't corrupt existing data but prevent new valid transactions
- **Availability**: CRITICAL - Network becomes unusable if block production stops

**Leios-Specific Considerations**: EB creation, voting, and certificate inclusion must not prevent regular block production or create bottlenecks.

### A3: Transaction Validity, Availability, and Determinism
**Description**: All transactions included in the blockchain must be cryptographically valid, available to all network participants for verification, and deterministic (transactions only consume fees if successfully included, a key Cardano property).

**CIA Impact:**
- **Confidentiality**: Not applicable - transactions are public once included
- **Integrity**: CRITICAL - Invalid transactions would corrupt the ledger state; non-deterministic behavior would break fee guarantees
- **Availability**: HIGH - Unavailable transactions prevent proper validation and syncing

**Leios-Specific Considerations**: EBs reference transactions that must be available when the EB is processed; voting nodes must verify transaction availability before voting; deterministic behavior must be preserved across the EB endorsement and certification process.

### A4: Operational Sustainability
**Description**: Computational and network resources consumed by Stake Pool Operators to participate in the protocol, including CPU, memory, storage, and bandwidth. Resource increases are acceptable as long as they are covered by corresponding incentives to maintain operational sustainability.

**CIA Impact:**
- **Confidentiality**: LOW - Resource usage patterns could reveal some operational information
- **Integrity**: MEDIUM - Resource exhaustion could compromise node operation and validation
- **Availability**: HIGH - Excessive resource usage could force SPOs offline or prevent participation

**Leios-Specific Considerations**: New responsibilities (EB creation, voting, additional network protocols) must not significantly increase SPO operational costs relative to incentives or create barriers to participation.

### A5: Decentralization
**Description**: The distribution of block production, voting power, and network participation across many independent operators.

**CIA Impact:**
- **Confidentiality**: LOW - Centralization patterns are observable but don't directly affect data secrecy
- **Integrity**: HIGH - Centralization increases risk of coordinated attacks on consensus
- **Availability**: HIGH - Centralized infrastructure creates single points of failure

### A6: High Throughput
**Description**: The enhanced transaction processing capacity that Leios provides beyond basic Praos liveness, enabling the network to handle significantly more transactions per unit time.

**CIA Impact:**
- **Confidentiality**: Not applicable - throughput is a performance metric
- **Integrity**: LOW - Reduced throughput doesn't corrupt data but may affect user expectations
- **Availability**: HIGH - Throughput reduction defeats the primary purpose of the Leios upgrade

**Leios-Specific Considerations**: EB certification failures, voting delays, or resource exhaustion attacks directly impact the throughput gains Leios is designed to provide.

## Threats

Notable threats to the system that could impact assets.

#### T1: Mempool Partitioning
**Description**: Attacker deliberately partitions the mempools of block producing nodes by submitting conflicting transactions (spending the same inputs) to different network segments, creating inconsistent views of valid transactions across the network.

**Prerequisites**:
- Control over multiple network positions to segment the peer-to-peer network
- Ability to create valid but conflicting transactions (same inputs, different outputs)
- Discovery of network topology and SPO peer relationships
- Timing coordination to submit conflicts before natural mempool synchronization

**Attack Vector**:
1. Attacker maps network topology and identifies cluster boundaries
2. Creates conflicting transaction pairs spending identical UTXOs
3. Submits Transaction A to Network Segment 1, Transaction B to Network Segment 2
4. Uses network position control (BGP, routing, eclipse techniques) to prevent cross-segment propagation
5. Slot/height battling SPOs from different segments create RBs endorsing different, conflicting transactions
6. Voting nodes must choose between conflicting EBs, potentially causing certification failures

**Cost**: HIGH - Requires significant network infrastructure, multiple nodes, and sustained coordination

**Likelihood**: LOW - Reduced attack surface due to coupled RB/EB production model, though possible when there are multiple eligible producers (slot / height battles).

**Impact**:
- **Throughput**: Different SPOs create conflicting EBs, causing vote splits and potential certification failures. This leads to throughput reduction when EBs fail certification, though system recovers in subsequent stages
- **Resources**: SPO's network bandwidth and compute resources wasted on processing, propagating, and voting on conflicting EBs that cannot all be certified
- **Trust**: Demonstrates network manipulation capability, though doesn't break core transaction guarantees

**Assets Affected**: High Throughput, Operational Sustainability

#### T2: Eclipse Attack on Voting Nodes
**Description**: Attacker isolates top voting nodes to manipulate vote collection by controlling their network connections and information flow.

**Prerequisites**:
- Control over significant network infrastructure (BGP routes, ISPs, or direct node connections)
- Knowledge of high-stake nodes' network addresses and topology
- Sustained resources to maintain isolation over multiple voting periods
- Timing coordination across multiple attack vectors

**Attack Vector**:
1. Identify network locations and peer connections of target voting nodes
2. Use BGP hijacking, DNS manipulation, or direct DoS to isolate nodes
3. Control information flow to isolated nodes (selective EB delivery)
4. Present different EBs to isolated vs. non-isolated voting nodes
5. Manipulate vote collection to either prevent certificates or enable invalid ones

**Cost**: VERY HIGH - Requires substantial network infrastructure control, ISP cooperation, or large-scale DDoS capabilities

**Impact**:
- **Vote Manipulation**: Limited impact due to quorum threshold - attacker needs to isolate significant voting stake
- **Throughput**: Reduction if enough voting nodes are offline, but system is resilient
- **Detectability**: Attack is highly visible through network monitoring and vote pattern analysis
- **Resource Cost**: High cost for attacker relative to limited impact on robust voting system

**Assets Affected**: Blockchain Safety, High Throughput

#### T3: Vote Flooding
**Description**: Malicious nodes flood the network with invalid or duplicate votes to overwhelm voting infrastructure and waste network resources.

**Prerequisites**:
- Access to network connectivity (minimal barrier)
- Knowledge of vote message format
- Basic understanding of voting protocol

**Attack Vector**:
1. Craft invalid votes (wrong signatures, non-existent EBs, duplicate votes)
2. Submit high volume of malicious votes through vote diffusion protocol
3. Target specific nodes or broadcast widely across network
4. Exploit any amplification in vote propagation mechanisms

**Cost**: VERY LOW - Requires minimal computational resources and network bandwidth

**Impact**:
- **Resource Consumption**: Forces legitimate nodes to process and validate spam votes
- **Network Congestion**: Increased bandwidth usage for vote diffusion protocol
- **Processing Overhead**: CPU cycles wasted on signature verification of invalid votes
- **Operational**: Potential degradation of node performance, but doesn't break consensus
- **Limited Scope**: Pull-based protocols provide natural rate limiting protection

**Assets Affected**: Operational Sustainability, High Throughput

#### T4: EB Withholding
**Description**: Eligible stake pools deliberately not announce or certify EBs when producing RBs they are entitled to create reducing network throughput.

**Prerequisites**:
- Stake pool eligibility for block production
- Economic incentive to withhold (e.g. censorship goals, reduced operational costs)

**Attack Vector**:
1. Win EB creation eligibility through normal VRF process, possibly enhanced by grinding
2. Create RB that does not announce an EB or don't include an already certified EB

**Cost**: LOW - No additional cost other than being a block producer, indirect opportunity cost of not included transaction fees

**Likelihood**: HIGH - Every block producer gets two opportunities to ignore EBs

**Impact**:
- **Throughput**: Reduced transaction processing capacity for this and next block opportunity. However, system may recover with next block production opportunity.
- **Resources**: Bandwidth and compute spent on voting wasted and needs to be redone.

**Assets Affected**: High Throughput

#### T5: Double Voting
**Description**: Nodes with delegated stake votes on multiple EBs that reference conflicting sets of transactions.

**Prerequisites**:
- Node is member on voting committee by stake
- Access to multiple conflicting EBs in the same voting period
- Malicious intent or compromised voting infrastructure

**Attack Vector**:
1. Receive or create multiple conflicting EBs for the same stage
2. Submit votes for multiple conflicting EBs instead of choosing one
3. Could enable multiple certificates for conflicting transaction sets
4. May coordinate with other compromised voting nodes

**Cost**: LOW-MEDIUM - Requires stake for voting eligibility, but double voting may be undetectable if EBs appear to be for different stages/pipelines

**Impact**:
- **Limited Effect**: Multiple certificates can exist but only RB inclusion affects chain selection
- **Resource Waste**: Additional bandwidth and processing for redundant certificates
- **No Safety Violation**: Chain safety depends on RB inclusion, not certificate existence
- **Detection Difficulty**: Voters may have plausible deniability if conflicting EBs aren't clearly marked as competing

**Assets Affected**: Operational Sustainability

#### T6: VRF Manipulation
**Description**: Attacker attempts to predict or manipulate EB eligibility by compromising the VRF (Verifiable Random Function) process.

**Prerequisites**:
- VRF private key compromise, or
- Cryptographic breakthrough against VRF security, or
- Implementation vulnerability in VRF generation/verification

**Attack Vector**:
1. Compromise VRF private keys through key extraction or side-channel attacks
2. Exploit implementation bugs in VRF computation
3. Use compromised keys to create favorable eligibility outcomes
4. Target specific slots or manipulate randomness to gain unfair advantage

**Cost**: VERY HIGH - Requires advanced cryptographic attacks or sophisticated key compromise

**Impact**:
- **Eligibility Bias**: Unfair advantage in EB creation opportunities
- **Centralization**: Could concentrate EB production in attacker's control
- **Cryptographic Failure**: Indicates fundamental security breach requiring protocol changes

**Assets Affected**: Blockchain Safety, Decentralization

#### T7: Stake Grinding
**Description**: Attacker manipulates stake distribution to influence voting power or EB eligibility through strategic delegation patterns.

**Prerequisites**:
- Significant economic resources to acquire or control stake
- Knowledge of stake distribution update timing (epoch boundaries)
- Ability to coordinate multiple delegation transactions

**Attack Vector**:
1. Accumulate stake through purchase or rental
2. Time delegation changes to maximize impact on upcoming epochs
3. Create multiple pools to spread influence while maintaining control
4. Coordinate with other actors to amplify manipulation effects

**Cost**: HIGH - Requires substantial capital investment in stake acquisition

**Impact**:
- **Voting Bias**: Disproportionate influence over EB certification
- **Eligibility Manipulation**: Increased EB creation opportunities
- **Centralization**: Concentration of power despite appearing decentralized

**Assets Affected**: Decentralization

#### T?: Honey Pot Contract

**Description**: An attacker deliberately makes ADA available on-chain so anyone races to claim it with the goal of producing many conflicting transactions. This is very similar to T1, but uses cryptocurrency instead of network resources.

**Prerequisites**:
- Knowledge of building a Cardano smart contract
- Enough ADA to appeal to enough users

**Attack Vector**:
1. Lock a lot of ADA into a script that allows anyone to take `amount` while the remainder must be kept in the script.
2. Advertise the honey pot and that `amount` of ADA is available for free.
3. Race with everyone in claiming the output.
    a. If attacker is successful, only transaction fees were spent and `amount` can go back into the honey pot.
4. Continue until funds run out.

**Cost**: HIGH - Enough ADA to appeal many concurrent users and keep the attack going. 

**Impact**:
- **Resource Waste**: Network processes all conflicting transactions trying to spend the honey pot output, but only one pays fees at a time. Highest costs are from perpetual storage when conflicting transactions are submitted concurrently.
- **Throughput**: Reduces available throughput by amount of transactions attracted by the honey pot.
- **Artifical traffic / low tps**: While this artifical traffic will account into the systems throughput, typically measured in transactions per second (tps), the attacker could require these transactions to be big and computationally costly, resulting in a relatively low tps addition.

**Assets Affected**: High Throughput, Operational Sustainability

#### T?: Delayed Praos Blocks

> [!WARN]
> Is this a threat or rather part of the Blockchain Safety asset?

**Description**: Delaying praos blocks due to long ledger state building (too many txs), impacting liveness and safety.

**Impact**:
- **Chain Quality**: Increased likelihood of chain forks and lower chain quality

**Assets Affected**: Blockchain Safety

#### T?: Excessive Chain Growth

> [!WARN]
> TODO and how do we describe threats that are not attacks?

**Description**: Chain growing too much due to honest demand and too high capacity parameterization (as a threat, not an attack). When SPOs cannot add as much storage as is needed, they cannot validate the chain and decentralization is impacted.

**Assets Affected**: Operational Sustainability, Decentralization

#### T8: Transaction Withholding
**Description**: Attacker creates EBs referencing non-existing transactions to waste network resources and disrupt certification.

**Prerequisites**:
- Block production eligibility (RB + EB creation)
- Ability to generate valid, but non-existing transaction references

**Attack Vector**:
1. Win EB creation eligibility through normal VRF process, possibly enhanced by grinding
1. Create valid but non-existent transaction references
1. Create EB referencing these unavailable transactions and announce it in RB
1. Voting nodes cannot verify transaction availability, preventing certification

**Cost**: LOW - No additional cost other than being a block producer, indirect opportunity cost of not included transaction fees

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM - Requires block production eligibility but straightforward to execute

**Impact**:
- **Resource Waste**: Network bandwidth consumed attempting to fetch non-existent transactions
- **Throughput**: Temporary reduction when EBs fail certification due to unavailable transactions
- **Operational**: SPO resources wasted on failed validation and fetching attempts

**Assets Affected**: High Throughput, Operational Sustainability

#### T9: Transaction Front-Running
**Description**: EB producers observe profitable transactions and reorder or insert their own transactions to extract value before the original transaction executes.

**Prerequisites**:
- EB creation eligibility
- MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) opportunities in transaction sets
- Knowledge of transaction dependencies and profitable patterns

**Attack Vector**:
1. Monitor mempool for profitable transaction patterns
2. Create competing or parasitic transactions
3. Include both in EB with favorable ordering for attacker
4. Extract value through arbitrage, sandwich attacks, or liquidations

**Cost**: LOW - Opportunity cost only, plus normal EB creation requirements

**Impact**:
- **Value Extraction**: Users receive worse execution prices
- **Market Inefficiency**: Creates unfair advantages for EB producers
- **Detectable**: Transaction patterns can reveal front-running behavior
- **Existing Issue**: Already present with RB producers, Leios increases frequency

**Assets Affected**: Transaction Validity/Availability/Determinism, Decentralization

#### T10: Hard Fork Coordination Attack
**Description**: Disruption during the hard fork transition period to split the network, cause instability, or prevent the hard fork from succeeding.

**Prerequisites**:
- Knowledge of hard fork activation timeline and governance process
- Control over significant network infrastructure or stake
- Influence over SPOs, dReps, or governance participants
- Coordination capabilities during transition window

**Attack Vector**:
1. **Governance Manipulation**: Influence SPOs and dReps to vote against or delay governance actions
2. **Readiness Signaling Attack**: Manipulate hard fork readiness signals to create false coordination
3. **Transition Timing**: Coordinate attacks precisely during hard fork activation
4. **Version Confusion**: Exploit incompatibilities between old/new nodes
5. **Infrastructure Targeting**: Attack critical infrastructure during vulnerable transition period

**Cost**: HIGH - Requires significant coordination, infrastructure control, or governance influence

**Impact**:
- **Hard Fork Prevention**: Could block beneficial protocol upgrades entirely
- **Network Split**: Persistent chain splits if coordination fails
- **Governance Disruption**: Undermines democratic upgrade process
- **Infrastructure Damage**: Critical period where network is most vulnerable
- **Recovery Complexity**: Requires coordinated response and potential manual intervention

**Assets Affected**: Blockchain Safety, Blockchain Liveness, High Throughput

#### T11: Backward Compatibility Exploitation
**Description**: Attacker exploits differences between old and new node behavior during transition period.

**Prerequisites**:
- Understanding of protocol differences between versions
- Access to both old and new node implementations
- Ability to craft messages that behave differently across versions

**Attack Vector**:
1. Identify behavioral differences between node versions
2. Craft messages/transactions that exploit these differences
3. Target mixed-version network segments
4. Cause inconsistent processing or validation failures

**Cost**: MEDIUM - Requires technical analysis but minimal infrastructure

**Impact**:
- **Inconsistency**: Different node versions may reach different conclusions
- **Resource Waste**: Nodes spend resources on incompatible processing
- **Operational**: May force emergency patches or version rollbacks

**Assets Affected**: Operational Sustainability, High Throughput

## Abstract

> [!NOTE]
>
> A short (\~200 word) description of the proposed solution and the technical issue being addressed.


## Motivation: why is this CIP necessary?

> [!NOTE]
> 
> A clear explanation that introduces a proposal's purpose, use cases, and stakeholders. If the CIP changes an established design, it must outline design issues that motivate a rework. For complex proposals, authors must write a [Cardano Problem Statement (CPS) as defined in CIP-9999][CPS] and link to it as the `Motivation`.


## Specification

> [!NOTE]
> 
> The technical specification should describe the proposed improvement in sufficient technical detail. In particular, it should provide enough information that an implementation can be performed solely based on the design outlined in the CIP. A complete and unambiguous design is necessary to facilitate multiple interoperable implementations.
> 
> This section must address the [Versioning](#versioning) requirement unless this is addressed in an optional Versioning section.
> 
> If a proposal defines structure of on-chain data it must include a CDDL schema.


## Rationale: how does this CIP achieve its goals?

> [!NOTE]
> 
> The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and what led to particular design decisions. It should describe alternate designs considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss significant objections or concerns raised during the discussion.
> 
> It must also explain how the proposal affects the backward compatibility of existing solutions when applicable. If the proposal responds to a [CPS][], the 'Rationale' section should explain how it addresses the CPS and answer any questions that the CPS poses for potential solutions.


## Path to active

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Organised in two sub-sections:


### Acceptance criteria

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Describes what are the acceptance criteria whereby a proposal becomes _'Active'_.
> 
> This sub-section must define a list of criteria by which the proposal can become active. Criteria must relate to observable metrics or deliverables and be reviewed by editors and project maintainers when applicable. For example: "The changes to the ledger rules are implemented and deployed on Cardano mainnet by a majority of the network", or "The following key projects have implemented support for this standard".


### Implementation plan

> [!NOTE]
> Either a plan to meet those criteria or `N/A` if not applicable.
> 
> This sub-section should define the plan by which a proposal will meet its acceptance criteria, when applicable. More, proposals that require implementation work in a specific project may indicate one or more implementors. Implementors must sign off on the plan and be referenced in the document's preamble.
> 
> In particular, an implementation that requires a hard-fork should explicitly mention it in its _'Implementation Plan'_.

## Versioning

> [!NOTE]
> 
> if Versioning is not addressed in Specification
> 
> CIPs must indicate how the defined Specification is versioned.  **Note** this does not apply to the CIP text, for which annotated change logs are automatically generated and [available through the GitHub UI](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits/differences-between-commit-views) as a history of CIP files and directories.
> 
> Authors are free to describe any approach to versioning that allows versioned alterations to be added without author oversight.  Stipulating that the proposal must be superseded by another is also considered to be valid versioning.
> 
> A single Versioning scheme can be placed either as a subsection of the Specification section or in an optional Versioning top-level section near the end.  If the Specification contains multiple specification subsections, each of these can have a Versioning subsection within it.

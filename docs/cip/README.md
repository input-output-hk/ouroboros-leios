## Abstract

> [!NOTE]
>
> A short (~200 word) description of the proposed solution and the technical
> issue being addressed.

The anticipated growth of the Cardano ecosystem necessitates a fundamental
enhancement of network throughput to accommodate increasing transaction volumes
and support complex decentralized applications.

To address this challenge, we propose a transition to Ouroboros Leios â€” a novel
consensus protocol within the Ouroboros family. Leios is specifically designed
for high-throughput operation while preserving the rigorous security properties
established by Ouroboros Praos.

Leios achieves its scalability through a decoupled block production and
aggregation mechanism. This allows for a higher rate of input-block generation,
followed by efficient endorsement and anchoring onto the main chain. This
document formally specifies the Leios protocol using Agda and provides a
detailed rationale and supporting evidence demonstrating its efficacy in
overcoming the throughput limitations inherent in the current Ouroboros Praos
protocol.

## Motivation: why is this CIP necessary?

While Cardano's current transaction processing capabilities often meet the
immediate demands of its user base, the underlying Ouroboros Praos consensus
protocol inherently imposes limitations on scalability. The critical requirement
for timely and reliable global propagation of newly generated blocks within a
short time interval necessitates a careful balancing act. This constraint
directly restricts the maximum size of individual blocks and the computational
resources available for the validation of transactions and Plutus scripts,
effectively establishing a ceiling on the network's transaction throughput that
cannot be overcome through simple parameter adjustments alone.

However, the dynamic growth of the Cardano ecosystem is increasingly revealing
the practical consequences of these inherent limitations. The Cardano mainnet
periodically experiences periods of significant congestion, where the volume of
transactions awaiting processing surpasses the network's ability to include them
in a timely manner. This congestion can lead to a tangible degradation in the
user experience, manifesting as delays in transaction confirmation. Moreover, it
poses substantial obstacles for specific use cases that rely on the efficient
processing of large volumes of transactions, such as the distribution of tokens
via airdrops, or the rapid and consistent updating of data by decentralized
oracles or partner chains.

The semi-sequential nature of block propagation in Ouroboros Praos, where blocks
are relayed from one block producer to the next across potentially
geographically distant nodes, is a key factor contributing to these limitations.
The necessity of completing this global dissemination within the few-second
period places a fundamental constraint on the rate at which new blocks, and
consequently the transactions they contain, can be added to the blockchain. This
architectural characteristic stands in contrast to the largely untapped
potential of the network's underlying infrastructure, where the computational
and bandwidth resources of individual nodes often remain significantly
underutilized.

To transcend these inherent scaling barriers and unlock the latent capacity of
the Cardano network, a fundamental evolution of the core consensus algorithm is
imperative. Ouroboros Leios represents a departure from the sequential
processing model of Praos, aiming to introduce mechanisms for parallel
transaction processing and more efficient aggregation of transaction data. By
reorganizing how transactions are proposed, validated, and ultimately recorded
on the blockchain, this protocol upgrade seeks to achieve a substantial increase
in the network's overall throughput, enabling it to handle a significantly
greater volume of transactions within a given timeframe.

The Cardano Problem Statement [CPS-18 Greater Transaction Throughput][cps-18]
further motivates the need for higher transaction throughput and marshals
quantitative evidence of existing mainnet bottlenecks. Realizing higher
transaction rates is also necessary for long-term Cardano techno-economic
viability as rewards contributions from the Reserve pot diminish: fees from more
transactions will be needed to make up that deficit and keep sound the finances
of stakepool operations. (Currently, the Reserve contributes more than 85% of
the reward of a typical epoch, with less than 15% of the reward coming from the
collection of transaction fees. In five years, however, the Reserve contribution
will be much diminished.) Because a major protocol upgrade like Leios will take
significant time to implement, test, and audit, it is important to began
implementation well before transaction demand on mainnet exceeds the
capabilities of Ouroboros Praos. The plot below shows the historically
diminishing rewards and a forecast of their continued reduction: the forecast is
mildly uncertain because the future pattern of staking behavior, transaction
fees, and node efficiency might vary considerably.

![Forecast of rewards on Cardano mainnet](images/reward-forecast-bau.svg)

Ouroboros Praos cannot support the high transaction volume needed to generate
the fees that will eventually be needed to offset the diminishing rewards.
However, as sustained throughput of transactions grows beyond 50 transactions
per second, there is more opportunity for simultaneously reducing fees,
augmenting the Treasury, and increasing SPO and delegator rewards.

## Specification

Leios extends Ouroboros Praos by enabling block producers to create an optional
second, larger block body called an [Endorser Block (EB)](#endorser-blocks-ebs)
alongside each standard
[Praos block (Ranking Block or RB)](#ranking-blocks-rbs). EBs undergo validation
by a dynamically selected committee of stake pools before inclusion in the
ledger.

### Protocol Overview

</p>

_Figure 1: Ouroboros Leios Protocol Flow_

</div>

Leios works through a five-step process that introduces new block types and
validation mechanisms:

**Step 1: Block Production**

When a stake pool wins block leadership, they **simultaneously** create two
things:

- **Ranking Block (RB)**: A standard Praos block with extended header fields to
  announce the second block
- **Endorser Block (EB)**: A larger block containing additional transaction references

**Step 2: EB Distribution**

Nodes receiving the RB header discover the announced EB and fetch its content.
The EB contains references to transactions.

**Step 3: Committee Validation**

A **voting committee** of stake pools validates the EB within a time window
called the **stage length** ($L$):

- Committee members are selected via sortition (lottery based on stake)
- Validators check the EB's transaction validity
- Valid EBs receive votes from committee members
- The stage has two phases: voting period ($L_\text{vote}$) + vote diffusion
  period ($L_\text{diff}$)

**Step 4: Certification**

If enough committee votes are collected such that the total stake exceeds a
**threshold** ($\tau$) (typically 60% of total stake), the EB becomes **certified**:

$$
\sum_{v \in \text{votes}} \text{stake}(v) \geq \tau \times \text{stake}_{\text{total}}
$$

This creates a compact **certificate** proving the EB's validity.

**Step 5: Chain Inclusion**

The next RB producer can include the certificate in their block **only if** all
conditions are met:

- A voting committee validated the EB within the stage duration $L$
- The next RB appears with sufficient delay to allow voting completion
- The subsequent RB producer includes the EB's certificate

This **conditional inclusion** maintains Praos safety guarantees while achieving
higher throughput when network timing permits. When included:

- The certified EB's transactions become part of the permanent ledger
- Throughput increases significantly for that segment of the chain
- If timing is insufficient, only the standard RB is included (maintaining Praos
  baseline)

### Protocol Component Details

The protocol extends Praos with three main elements:

#### Ranking Blocks (RBs)

RBs are Praos blocks extended to support Leios by optionally announcing EBs in
their headers and embedding EB certificates in their bodies. In addition to
including transactions directly, RBs can also incorporate transactions from
certified EBs. The Leios-specific additions are: the optional `announced_eb`
field in the block header which announces a new EB by hash, the optional
`certified_eb` field in the header which references the EB being certified, and
the optional `eb_certificate` in the block body which contains the certificate
attesting to the validity of an EB through
[BLS-based voting](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/crypto-benchmarks.rs/Specification.md)
by a committee of stake pools.

#### Endorser Blocks (EBs)

EBs are produced by the same stake pool that created the corresponding
announcing RB. They serve to reference additional transactions, increasing
throughput beyond what can be included directly in the RB. When an EB is
announced in an RB header via the `announced_eb` field, a voting period begins
as described in
[Voting Committee and Certificates](#voting-committee-and-certificates). Only
RBs that directly extend the announcing RB are eligible to certify the announced
EB by including a certificate.

</details>

#### Voting Committee and Certificates

The voting committee is a group of stake pools selected to validate EBs through
BLS-based vote aggregation. Only EBs that achieve the required quorum ($\tau$) of votes
are certified and eligible for inclusion in RBs.

Votes are categorized as either **persistent** (selected for the entire epoch)
or **non-persistent** (selected per EB), following the Fait Accompli sortition
scheme. Multiple votes from a single voter can be bundled together to reduce
network overhead.

### Protocol Parameters and Network Characteristics

The following sections distinguish between tunable **protocol parameters**
(which can be adjusted via governance) and observed **network characteristics**
(which depend on topology and node capabilities).

**Network Characteristics**

### Specification for votes and certificates

Leios requires a voting and certificate scheme to validate endorser blocks. This
specification defines a BLS-based implementation that meets the protocol
requirements with concrete performance characteristics.

#### Committee Selection

**Persistent Voters**: Selected once per epoch using the
[Fait Accompli scheme](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/fait-accompli-committee-selection-improving-the-size-security-tradeoff-of-stake-based-committees/).
These pools vote in every election during the epoch.

**Non-persistent Voters**: Selected per EB via local sortition based on the
election identifier. The probability that a pool with stake fraction $Ïƒ$
receives $k$ votes follows:

$$
\mathcal{P}(k) := \frac{(n \cdot \sigma)^k \cdot e^{- n \cdot \sigma}}{k!}
$$

**Committee Size**: Minimum 500 voters required for security, with quorum
threshold of at least 60% of total stake.

#### Key Registration

Stake pools register BLS keys with proof-of-possession:

- **Public Key**: 96 bytes (BLS12-381 with compression)
- **Proof of Possession**: 96 bytes
- **Pool ID**: 28 bytes
- **KES Signature**: 448 bytes
- **Total Registration Size**: 668 bytes

Keys are registered as part of operational certificates and do not require
periodic rotation.

#### Vote Structure

**Persistent Votes** (90 bytes):

- Election ID: 8 bytes
- EB hash: 32 bytes
- Pool identifier: 2 bytes
- Vote signature: 48 bytes

**Non-persistent Votes** (164 bytes):

- Election ID: 8 bytes
- EB hash: 32 bytes
- Pool ID: 28 bytes
- Eligibility signature: 48 bytes
- Vote signature: 48 bytes

Multiple votes from the same issuer can be bundled to reduce network overhead.

#### Certificate Structure

Certificates aggregate votes into compact proofs, with size formula:

$$
\text{certificate bytes} = 136 + \left\lceil \frac{m}{8} \right\rceil + 76 \times (n - m)
$$

Where m = persistent voters, n = total committee size.

**Components**:

- Election ID and EB hash: 40 bytes
- Persistent voter bitset: âŒˆm/8âŒ‰ bytes
- Non-persistent voter IDs: 28Ã—(n-m) bytes
- Eligibility proofs: 48Ã—(n-m) bytes
- Aggregate signatures: 96 bytes

**Size Characteristics**: Under 10 kB for realistic Cardano mainnet stake
distributions (assuming 80% persistent, 20% non-persistent voters).

#### Performance Requirements

<div align="center">
<a name="table-3"></a>

#### Protocol Routines

The following sequence covers both the new node routines and the mini-protocol messages exchanged between nodes. The diagram below shows how these internal and network interactions unfold over time.

<div align="center">
<a name="figure-5"></a>
<img src="images/leios-sequence-diagram.svg" alt="Leios Protocol Sequence Diagram" width="800">

_Figure 5: Leios Protocol Sequence Diagram - Temporal Flow of Mini-Protocol Interactions_
</div>

The protocol follows this temporal sequence:
- **1a**: Block creation
- **1b**: Header diffusion via RbHeaderRelay to all peers
- **2a**: Header processing and equivocation detection
- **2b**: EB content requests via EbRelay/EbFetch
- **2c**: EB content delivery to requesting nodes
- **3aâ†’3b**: Missing transaction fetching via TxFetch (if needed)
- **4a**: EB validation and vote decision
- **4b**: Vote diffusion via VoteRelay to committee
- **5**: Vote aggregation and certificate creation
- **6a**: Next block creation with certificate
- **6b**: New certified block diffusion via ChainSync
- **7**: Peer-to-peer header relaying (cycle repeats)

**OnRBCreate(chain C)** *(Steps 1a & 6a)*

This routine handles block production when the node wins leadership (Step 1a) and certificate inclusion when available (Step 6a). It simultaneously creates both an RB and EB, checks for any available certificates to include, fills both blocks with transactions, establishes cross-references, and initiates diffusion via RbHeaderRelay.

<details>
<summary>OnRBCreate pseudocode</summary>

```pseudocode
// Create new RB extending current chain
RB = create_empty_rb(C)
EB = create_empty_eb()

// Check for certificate to include
if exists cert in EBcerts where cert.target == tail(C) and
   (timestamp(RB) - timestamp(cert.RBannounced) > L_vote + L_diff):
    
    RB.EBcertificate = cert
    
    if exists EB in EBs where cert.Target == hash(EB):
        state_prime = State(C).extend(EB.Body)
        M = M.tryToExtend(state_prime, M)  // Remove included transactions
else:
    // No EB certificate is included in this RB (âŠ¥ denotes 'none')
    RB.EBcertificate = âŠ¥

// Fill blocks with transactions
RB.Body = select_transactions(M, RB_size_limit)
EB.Body = select_transactions(M \ RB.Body, EB_size_limit)
M.remove(RB.Body + EB.Body)

// Set reference hashes
EB.RBannounced = hash(RB)
RB.EBannounced = hash(EB)

// Adopt new chain and initiate diffusion sequence
C = C || RB
diffuse_chain(C):
  // Step 1b: First diffuse RB header via RbHeaderRelay â†’ triggers OnRBHeaderReceived (Step 2a)
  rbHeaderRelay.diffuse(RB.header, RB.opportunity)
  
  // EB content diffusion happens via EbRelay when peers request it
  // after receiving the header â†’ triggers OnEBContentReceived (Step 2c)
  
  // TODO: Exact diffusion timing and coordination undefined (issue #470)
  // Full RB body diffused via existing ChainSync/BlockFetch protocols

```

**OnEBContentReceived(EB, slot, issuer)** *(Step 2c)*

This routine handles EB content received via EbRelay or EbFetch, checks for missing transactions, and prepares for validation.

<details>
<summary>OnEBContentReceived pseudocode</summary>

```pseudocode
// Verify this EB was announced by corresponding RB header
corresponding_header = RBheaders.get_by_issuer_slot(issuer, slot)
if corresponding_header == âŠ¥ or corresponding_header.announced_eb != hash(EB):

    trigger_eb_validation(EB, corresponding_header)
```

</details><br />

**OnMissingTxsReceived(txs, EB)** *(Step 3b)*

This routine handles missing transactions received via TxFetch and triggers EB validation once all required transactions are available.

<details>
<summary>OnMissingTxsReceived pseudocode</summary>

```pseudocode
// Add transactions to local storage
for tx in txs:
    add_transaction(tx)

// Check if we now have all transactions for this EB
if have_all_transactions_for_eb(EB):

```

</details><br />

**OnEBValidationComplete(EB, corresponding_header, is_valid)** *(Step 4a)*

This routine handles completed EB validation and determines whether to vote.

<details>
<summary>OnEBValidationComplete pseudocode</summary>

```pseudocode
if not is_valid:
    return  // Invalid EB, don't vote

h = corresponding_header

// Check timing constraints
if (current_time - timestamp(h) >= L_vote):
    return  // Voting period expired

// Wait for equivocation check period (must wait 3Î”_hdr)
if (current_time - timestamp(h) <= 3*Î”_hdr):

</details><br />

**OnVoteReceived(Vote v)** *(Step 5)*

This routine processes incoming votes by validating and storing them, then checking if enough votes have been collected to create a certificate. Once a certificate is created and the voting period ends, the node optimistically adds the certified EB's transactions to its mempool.

<details>
<summary>OnVoteReceived pseudocode</summary>

```pseudocode

```pseudocode

```

</details><br />

**OnEquivocationProofReceived(proof)** *(Network Event)*

This routine processes incoming equivocation proofs from other nodes. An equivocation proof consists of two conflicting RB headers from the same issuer and slot with different block hashes, proving that the producer violated the protocol.

<details>
<summary>OnEquivocationProofReceived pseudocode</summary>

```pseudocode
// Verify proof structure: two different headers, same issuer/slot
if proof.header1.issuer == proof.header2.issuer and

    // Verify both headers are cryptographically valid
    if verify_vrf_proof(proof.header1, proof.op1) and verify_signatures(proof.header1) and
       verify_vrf_proof(proof.header2, proof.op2) and verify_signatures(proof.header2):

        mark_as_equivocating(proof.header1.issuer, proof.header1.slot)
```

</details><br />

**isValidRB(RB)** *(Step 6b)*

This validation routine ensures RBs received via ChainSync meet all Leios requirements: valid Praos header and VRF proof, and if present, a valid certificate that properly references the previously announced EB with sufficient timing delay.

<details>
<summary>isValidRB pseudocode</summary>

```pseudocode
if not validate_header(RB) or not verify_vrf(RB):
    return false

if RB.EBcertificate != âŠ¥:
    if not validate_certificate(RB.EBcertificate):
        return false
    if RB.EBcertificate.target != previous_block(RB).EBannounced:
        return false
    if (timestamp(RB) - timestamp(RB.EBcertificate.RBannounced)) <= L_vote + L_diff:
        return false

return true
```
</details>

#### Auxiliary Functions

**State S.extend(Transaction List Txs)**

This function attempts to apply a list of transactions sequentially to a ledger state, returning the resulting state or âŠ¥ if any transaction fails validation.

<details>
<summary>State.extend pseudocode</summary>

```pseudocode
// Apply transactions sequentially to state
for each tx in Txs:
    if not validate_transaction(tx, current_state):
        return âŠ¥
    current_state = apply_transaction(tx, current_state)
return current_state
```

</details><br />

**Mempool M.tryToExtend(State S, Transaction List Txs)**

This function attempts to add new transactions to the mempool by testing each transaction's validity against the current ledger state extended with existing mempool transactions.

<details>
<summary>Mempool.tryToExtend pseudocode</summary>

```pseudocode
A = S.extend(M)
M_prime = M

for each tx in Txs:
    A_prime = A.extend(tx)
    if A_prime != âŠ¥:
        A = A_prime
        M_prime.add(tx)

return M_prime
```

</details><br />

**is_persistent_voter(pool_id, stake_distribution)**

This function determines if a pool is a persistent voter for the current epoch using the Fait Accompli scheme. Implementation may cache this result for efficiency.

**local_sortition_check(election_id, stake_fraction, committee_size)**

This function determines if a non-persistent voter is eligible based on local sortition using Poisson distribution as specified in the BLS certificate scheme.

**has_equivocation_proof(issuer, slot)**

This function checks if the node has received an equivocation proof for a specific issuer and slot, indicating that the producer should be ignored for voting and EB processing.

**diffuse_equivocation_proof(proof)**

This function diffuses an equivocation proof to the network so other nodes can become aware of the misbehaving producer and ignore their EBs/votes accordingly.

**fetch_eb_content(eb_hash)**

This function initiates fetching of EB content. For fresh EBs announced in recent RB headers, this uses **EbRelay** for immediate diffusion to enable voting. For historical EBs during chain sync or when reconstructing ledger state, this uses **EbFetch** to request specific EBs by hash.

**fetch_missing_transactions(tx_refs, EB)**

This function fetches missing transactions referenced by an EB via TxFetch.  
Instead of using transaction hashes, an efficient optimization is to request missing transactions by their index in the EB body.

**continue_diffusing_eb(EB)**

This function continues diffusing EB content to other peers via EbRelay.

**trigger_eb_validation(EB, header)**

This function initiates asynchronous validation of an EB's transactions.

**have_all_transactions_for_eb(EB)**

This function checks if all transactions referenced by an EB are locally available.

**get_header_for_eb(EB)**

This function retrieves the RB header that announced a given EB.

### Network

As outlined above, Leios splits transactions between RBs and EBs, with EB inclusion dependent on committee voting and certification. Unlike Ouroboros Praos where the RB chain contains all necessary data, Leios nodes require additional message types to:

- **Reconstruct ledger state**: EBs containing certified transactions
- **Participate in consensus**: Vote on EBs and construct certificates  
- **Detect equivocation**: RB headers from competing forks

#### Message Types and Mini-Protocols

Leios introduces **six new mini-protocols** to handle the additional message types:

<div align="center">
<a name="table-6"></a>

| **Message Type** | **Purpose** | **Mini-Protocol** | **Structure** |
| :--------------: | ----------- | :---------------: | --------------- |
| RB Headers | Detect equivocation for voting decisions | **RbHeaderRelay** | (slot, issuer) pairs |
| Fresh EBs | Enable committee validation and voting | **EbRelay** | (issuer, slot, size) triplets |  
| Committee Votes | Construct certificates for EB inclusion | **VoteRelay** | (EB slot, vote issuer) pairs |
| Equivocation Proofs | Notify network of misbehaving producers | **EquivRelay** | pairs of conflicting RB headers |
| Historical EBs | Reconstruct ledger from certified EBs | **EbFetch** | slot and hash |
| Transaction Bodies | Resolve EB transaction references (when TxsByRef) | **TxFetch** | tx position within EB |

_Table 6: Leios Mini-Protocols_

</div>

> [!Warning]
> **TODO Mini-protocol specification**
>
> For each mini-protocol specify: purpose, message types, state machine, key parameters, and security notes.

### Mempool management

> [!Warning]
>
> This section is work in progress.

- Mempool enlarged for both RB and EB txs.
- On EB announcement, optimistically include EB txs in mempool (pending
  certification).
- If EB not certified, revalidate/reinsert its txs.
- Remove txs from mempool when included in RB or certified EB.
- Validate txs against current ledger state before mempool admission.
- RB producer resolves RB/EB tx conflicts at block production.
- Mempool does not track conflicting indices; relies on ledger rules.

### Incentives

> [!Warning]
>
> This section is work in progress.

- Reward EB creation, even if some EBs are not included in the final chain
- Motivate voter participation, while blocking system gaming
- Distribute fees among EB producers, main block producers, and voters

## Rationale: how does this CIP achieve its goals?

### How Leios increases throughput

The throughput of a Nakamoto consensus like Ouroboros Praos is intrinsically
limited by the strict requirement for rapid global propagation of each block
approximately before the next leader produces a block. Leios escapes that
limitation by allowing block producers to create larger endorser blocks (EBs)
that are voted on by a dynamically selected representative committee of stake
pools, ensuring broad participation in the validation process. The voting
process on these endorser blocks occurs in a more relaxed and extended manner
over a multi-slot stage, allowing for greater network latency tolerance. When a
quorum is reached, that quorum is recorded in a subsequent Praos block. The
majority voting by this committee ensures consensus on the endorser block while
inheriting and maintaining Praos's robust resistance to adversarial activity, as
the final commitment is anchored in the secure Praos chain.

> [!WARNING]
> TODO:

> - Re-add or drop analogies?

<!--
As a result of this decoupled approach, Leios can utilize nearly the full
bandwidth available to the network of nodes without requiring unrealistically
fast propagation of blocks: Leios employs a structured, multi-stage process
where endorser blocks are announced and then voted upon in subsequent stages
before being certified by a Praos block. Think of Praos as a single-lane highway
where every car (block) needs to travel the entire length before the next can
start. Leios, in contrast, is like having larger vehicles (endorser blocks) that
undergo inspection and approval before joining the main highway (Praos chain),
achieving higher capacity through this validation process.

In analogy, imagine Praos as a single courier diligently collecting and
delivering individual letters one by one, limiting the delivery speed to their
individual capacity. Ouroboros Leios, however, operates like a mail sorting
office where larger packages (endorser blocks) are prepared and then go through
a quality inspection process (voting) before being dispatched by the main
courier (Praos chain), achieving significantly higher delivery volume through
this structured validation approach.
-->

Concretely, the [specified protocol and parameterization](#specification)
results in roughly a **10x** throughput increase by combining the transaction
capacity of regular blocks with that of certified EBs. The formula below
expresses this: throughput equals the rate of regular block production times the
sum of their capacity and the additional capacity from Endorser Blocks that are
certified.

> [!WARNING]
> What about the maximum number / size of referenced transactions?

$$
\text{Throughput} = f_{\text{RB}} \times \left( S_\text{RB} + S_\text{EB} \times f_\text{EB} \right)
$$

Where:
- $f_{\text{RB}}$ â€” Rate of RB production (protocol parameter)
- $S_\text{RB}$ â€” Maximum size of an RB (protocol parameter)
- $S_\text{EB}$ â€” Maximum size of an EB (protocol parameter)
- $f_\text{EB}$ â€” Fraction of RBs that include an EB as observed under realistic
  network conditions and timing constraints.

While even higher throughput may be possible, and should be explored during
implementation to validate mainnet compatible parameters, increasing the
capacity of Cardano further is likely blocked by the **significantly increased**
potential chain growth. _Assuming sustained demand_ of `100 tx/s` of [current
average
sized](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/tree/main/docs/cost-estimate#cost-revenue-analysis)
transactions of `~1400 Bytes`, the chain would grow `~11 GBytes` per day or
`~337 GBytes` per month. Pushing this even higher did not sound reasonable and
would require a solution to the **chain growth problem**, which is out of scope
of this CIP and may even demand a dedicated CPS.

See also [evidence section](#evidence-that-leios-provides-high-throughput)
for empirical studies on possible throughput.

### Why this protocol variant

The proposed protocol is a radically simplified version of what was published in
the [Leios research paper][leios-paper]. The simplifcations were primarily made
to reduce the concurrent processing of Cardano transactions as much as possible
while still allowing roughly a 10x throughput increase.

The protocol design as published is optimal in its usage of available network
and compute resources, but comes at the cost of significantly increased
inclusion latency (> 5x) and a high level of concurrency. Both of which are
undesirable in a real-world deployment onto the Cardano mainnet and need to be
carefully weighed against the throughput increase:

**Higher latency** of transactions reaching the ledger (a.k.a settlement time)
allows for higher throughput because work can be performed for a longer time.
This is particularly evident with protocol designs that have many rounds and
consequently many network roundtrips. For example, preparing input blocks as
described in the paper is an additional round of validation and communication.
High latency is however a straight-forward drawback and will impact both,
applications built on Cardano and end user experience. As also stated in the
goals of [CPS-18][cps-18], a deployment of Leios should not result in
unreasonable increases of settlement time. In the mid-term potential synergies
with [Peras](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0140)
could make higher latency pipeline designs feasible again.

**Higher concurrency** allows for higher throughput by doing more transaction
processing at the same time. In the published design and otherwise discussed
variants concurrency is introduced by allowing agreement on sequences of
transactions independently of the Proas block production. This is the case for
when endorser blocks would be announced separately from Praos blocks or input
blocks be produced on a completely separate schedule. While such protocol
designs often result in higher latency due to more rounds, concurrency in itself
gives rise to the dedicated problem of _conflicting transactions_.

### Why Leios is practical to implement

> [!WARNING]
> TODO:
>
> - Shorten?
> - Incorporate: it's rather simple - offers minimal changes to existing implementation
> - Could also mention here:
>   - meets most urgent need - the economic sustainable threshold (from motivation)
>   - allows for progressive updates of infrastructure (node operators)

Leios is designed as an overlay protocol to Praos and consequently changes to
Cardano node infrastructure are often extensional. The existing network
protocols do not need to change, while the new mini-protocols for diffusion of
EBs and votes are to defined using the existing network protocol framework.

Besides storing ranking blocks, consensus nodes will be required to store and
serve EBs and the mempool requires a size increase, optimistic adoption of EBs
and generally less aggressive pruning of transactions. Leios adds complexity to
chain selection and adopting blocks as ledger state construction needs to be
deferred to not impact (ranking) block diffusion. Adjustments to the rewards
model will also be required.

The required cryptographic primitives are already used in production in various
parts of the Cardano and blockchain ecosystems. The performance of the
cryptographic operations required for Leios is demonstrated by a prototype
implementation[^3] and the benchmarks in the Appendix [Cryptographic
benchmarks](#cryptographic-benchmarks). The small size (less than 9 kB) of Leios
certificates is documented in the Appendix [Certificate size for realistic stake
distributions](#certificate-size-for-realistic-stake-distributions).

The [Resource requirements](#resource-requirements), discussed below, modestly
increase the requirements for running a Cardano node but not beyond commonly
available commodity hardware.

### Evidence and simulation analysis

#### Metrics

> [!NOTE]
>
> This is a preliminary set of metrics that will be finalized when the Leios
> protocol variants are finalized and the simulation studies are complete.

The performance of a protocol like Leios can be characterized in terms of its
efficient use of resources, its total use of resources, the probabilities of
negative outcomes due to the protocol's design, and the resilience to adverse
conditions. Metrics measuring such performance depend upon the selection of
protocol parameters, the network topology, and the submission of transactions.
The table below summarizes key metrics for evaluating Leios as a protocol and
individual scenarios (parameters, network, and load).

|            | Adversarial stake, $`\eta_\text{adversary}(s)`$           | Fractional loss in throughput due to adversial stake of $`s`$                                                   |

**_Spatial efficiency:_** Leios necessarily imposes some disk overhead beyond
the raw bytes needed to store transactions themselves. This overhead includes
the EBs and RBs associated with storing transactions. The spatial efficiency
metric is defined as the ratio of the total bytes of transactions included in
the ledger to the total persistent storage required by the protocol.

$$
`
\epsilon_\text{spatial} = \frac{\text{total bytes of transactions included in the ledger}}{\text{total bytes of EBs and RBs}}
`
$$

**_Temporal efficiency:_** As is true for Praos, there is a delay between
submitting a transaction and its being included in the ledger and there is a
finite chance that it never is included in the ledger. Before a transaction is
eligible to be included in a new IB, it must be validated and placed in the
memory pool. It is cleanest to measure the time from the transaction reaching
the local memory pool of the node where it was submitted to the time when it is
included in the ledger, via a Praos block. The same metric applies both to Praos
and to Leios. In aggregate, we measure the temporal efficiency as the fraction
of transactions that reach the ledger, as function of the number of slots
elapsed. The quantity $`\epsilon_\text{temporal}(\infty)`$ is the fraction of
submitted transactions that ever reach the ledger.

$$
`
\epsilon_\text{temporal}(s) = \text{fraction of transactions included in the ledger within } s \text{ slots of their inclusion in a local memory pool}
`
$$

**_Network efficiency:_** Effective utilization of the network can be
characterized by the ratio of bytes of transactions reaching the ledger to the
average network traffic per node. (This could also be computed individually for
each node and used as a local metric.)

$$
`
\epsilon_\text{network} = \frac{(\text{bytes of valid transactions reaching the ledger}) \cdot (\text{number of nodes in the network})}{\text{total bytes of network traffic}}
`
$$

**_TX inclusion:_** In Leios, it is possible that a transaction might have to
wait for multiple EB production opportunities before being included in an EB.
The characteristic time for such inclusion in an EB depends on the EB production
rate and mempool management. This is correlated with how long the transaction
waits in the memory pool before being selected for inclusion.

$$
`
\tau_\text{inclusion} = \text{mean number of slots for a transaction to be included in any EB}
`
$$

**_Voting failure:_** An unlucky set of VRF evaluations might result in
insufficient voters being selected in a given pipeline, thus making it
impossible to certify an EB in that pipeline.

$$
`
p_\text{noquorum} = \text{probability of sufficient voters to achieve a quorum in a given pipeline}
`
$$

**_Network egress:_** Cloud service providers typically charge for network
egress rather than for network ingress. The quantity $`q_\text{egress}`$ is
simply the number of bytes sent from a node per unit time.

**_Disk usage:_** Leios requires that EBs and RBs be stored permanently; votes
need not be stored permanently, however. The quantity $`q_\text{disk}`$ is the
total number of EB and RB bytes generated per unit time.

**_I/O operations:_** Some cloud service providers limit or bill input/output
operations on a per-second capacity basis. The number of I/O operations depends
upon the filesystem's block size $`b`$, not on the logical number of writes to
disk by the protocol: e.g., writing an EB of 32,768 bytes might consist of 64
I/O operations on a filesystem having a 512-byte block size. We assume that disk
caching and delayed writes smooth out the unevenness in I/O operations, so that
the mean $`\bar{q}_\text{iops}`$ is the best metric here.

**_Mean CPU usage:_** Computation resources consumed by the number are
quantified as $`\bar{q}_\text{vcpu}`$, which is the mean number of virtual CPU
cores utilized by the protocol.

**_Peak CPU usage:_** Because CPU usage varies depending upon the node's
activity, the maximum number of virtual CPU cores utilized by the protocol
during any slot, $`\hat{q}_\text{vcpu}`$, provides a useful indication of
computational burstiness and of how a virtual machine should be sized for Leios.

**_Bandwidth:_** If the bandwidth for inter-node communication drops below a
given value, then the throughput of Leios (at a given level of demand) will be
drop, as network congesting occurs.

$$
`
\eta_\text{bandwidth}(b) = \frac{\text{bytes of transactions reaching the ledger if links have bandwidth } b}{\text{bytes of transactions reaching the ledger if bandwidth were infinite}}
`
$$

**_Adversarial stake:_** Similarly, when adversarial stake is appreciable and
active, the throughput of Leios might be drop.

$$
`
\eta_\text{adversary}(s) = \frac{\text{bytes of transactions reaching the ledger without adversarial activity}}{\text{bytes of transactions reaching the ledger with adversarial activity given fraction } s \text{ of the total stake}}
`
$$

**_Fees:_** Fee metrics relate to consumption of collateral. Leios may consume
collateral for transactions that conflict when EBs are processed.

$$
`
\kappa_\text{success}(c) = \text{average collateral paid for a successful transaction when it conflicts with a fraction } c \text{ of the memory pool}
`
$$

$$
`
\kappa_\text{failure}(c) = \text{average collateral paid for a failed transaction when it conflicts with a fraction } c \text{ of the memory pool}
`
$$

### Simulation results

The Leios paper[^2] provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the safety and
throughput of the protocol. That has been reinforced and demonstrated by
prototype simulations written in Haskell and Rust.

The simulations demonstrate that bandwidth is partitioned between IBs, EBs,
votes, and RBs so that congestion in one message type does not spill over into
congestion for other message types. Because IBs are the largest messages, these
are the ones first subject to congestion. The plot below shows the appearance of
congestion effects in the Haskell simulation at 8 IB/s for 98 kB IBs. (Note that
the Haskell simulation represents TCP more faithfully than the Rust one.) Even
at this high throughput, IBs arrive at all nodes in the network with 100%
success and mostly within five seconds. This implies that the stage length could
be as short a five seconds per stage.

![Simulated time in flight for IBs](images/elapsed-IB.png)

In terms of the transaction lifecycle, transaction typically reach IBs rapidly
for high-throughput settings of Leios parameters, but it takes tens of seconds
for the to become referenced by an EB. Referencing by an RB takes longer, often
close to 100 seconds.

### Feasible protocol parameters

The table below documents a set of Leios protocol parameters that provided high
throughput and reasonably fast settlement in the prototype Haskell and Rust
simulations of Leios. The exact choice of parameters that would be adopted on
the Cardano mainnet must be subject to discussion and consideration of
tradeoffs.

The analysis
[Committee size and quorum requirement](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/technical-report-1.md#committee-size-and-quorum-requirement)
in the first Leios Technical Report indicates that the Leios committee size
should be no smaller than 500 votes and the quorum should be at least 60% of
those votes. However, the proposed Fait Accompli[^1] scheme wFA<sup>LS</sup>
achieves compact certificates that do not become larger as the number of voters
increases, so larger committee sizes might be permitted for broader SPO
participation and higher security. The committee size should be large enough
that fluctuations in committee membership do not create an appreciable
probability of an adversarial quorum when the adversarial stake is just under
50%. The quorum size should be kept large enough above 50% so that those same
fluctuations do not prevent an honest quorum. Larger committees require more
network traffic, of course.

### Resource requirements

The resource requirements for operating Leios nodes have been estimated from
benchmarking and simulation studies. The benchmark values for various Leios
operations come either from measurements of the cryptography prototype[^3] or
from the IOG benchmarking cluster for the Cardano node. These were input to the
Haskell and Rust simulators for Leios to make holistic estimates of resource
usage of operating nodes.

At high throughput, network egress can become a significant cost for nodes
hosted on some cloud-computing providers. The violin plots below indicate that
at the higher throughput that Leios can support, network egress can reach nearly
2 MB/s.

![Simulation of Leios network egress](images/network.png)

Disk usage is correlated with network usage, as most of the blocks moving over
the network also need to be persisted permanently; only the votes do not require
disk storage. The plots below demonstrate that disk usage scales directly as the
product of the IB rate and the IB size.

![Simulation of Leios disk usage](images/disk.png)

Both the average CPU usage and the peak CPU usage are relevant for deciding how
to provision hardware for Leios nodes. The following plots indicate that two
CPUs are sufficient for sustained and for peak Leios operation at high
throughput. Real deployments should over-provision CPU, of course, in order to
handle rare extraordinary peak conditions and to speed syncing from genesis.

![Simulation of average CPU usage for Leios](images/cpu-mean.png)

![Simulation of peak CPU usage for Leios](images/cpu-peak.png)

Overall the most significant Leios hardware requirement changes compared to
Praos are the higher levels of network egress and the rapidly growing disk space
to store the Leios blocks. CPU requirements are quite similar to existing Praos
deployments.

### Operating costs

A detailed cost analysis of Leios deployment is documented in
[Leios node operating costs](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/cost-estimate/README.md)
in the github repository for the Leios R&D effort. The major conclusion of that
report is the following table that relates IB production rate, assuming IBs are
the maximum size of existing Praos blocks, to the cost per node and the total
cost of all nodes.

| IB/s Rate | Cost per Node (Avg) | Network Cost (10,000 nodes) |
| --------: | ------------------: | --------------------------: |
|      0.05 |       $80 USD/month |          $800,000 USD/month |
|         1 |      $200 USD/month |        $2,000,000 USD/month |
|         5 |      $700 USD/month |        $7,000,000 USD/month |
|        10 |    $1,300 USD/month |       $13,000,000 USD/month |
|        20 |    $2,500 USD/month |       $25,000,000 USD/month |
|        30 |    $3,600 USD/month |       $36,000,000 USD/month |

_Required TPS for Infrastructure Cost Coverage:_ Using average transaction sizes
and fees, we can calculate the required TPS to generate enough fees to cover
infrastructure costs.

| Infrastructure Cost (USD/month) | Required ADA (at $0.45/ADA) | TPS (Avg Tx) | TPS (Min Tx) | Equivalent IB/s |
| ------------------------------: | --------------------------: | -----------: | -----------: | --------------: |
|                        $800,000 |                   1,777,778 |         0.31 |         0.40 |           0.004 |
|                      $2,000,000 |                   4,444,444 |         0.78 |         1.00 |           0.011 |
|                      $7,000,000 |                  15,555,556 |         2.72 |         3.49 |           0.039 |
|                     $13,000,000 |                  28,888,889 |         5.05 |         6.48 |           0.072 |
|                     $25,000,000 |                  55,555,556 |         9.71 |        12.47 |           0.139 |
|                     $36,000,000 |                  80,000,000 |        13.99 |        17.96 |           0.200 |

_Required TPS for Current Reward Maintenance:_ To maintain current reward levels
(~48 million ADA monthly) through transaction fees as the Reserve depletes.

| Year | Reserve Depletion | Rewards from Fees (ADA) | Required TPS (Avg Tx) | Required IB/s |
| ---: | ----------------: | ----------------------: | --------------------: | ------------: |
| 2025 |               ~0% |                       0 |                     0 |             0 |
| 2026 |              ~13% |               6,240,000 |                  10.9 |          0.16 |
| 2027 |              ~24% |              11,520,000 |                  20.1 |          0.29 |
| 2028 |              ~34% |              16,320,000 |                  28.5 |          0.41 |
| 2029 |              ~43% |              20,640,000 |                  36.1 |          0.52 |
| 2030 |              ~50% |              24,000,000 |                  41.9 |          0.60 |

Note that by 2029, to compensate for Reserve depletion, the network would need
to process approximately 36 TPS with average-sized transactions, requiring an
Input Block rate of around 0.52 IB/s, roughly 10 times the current mainnet
throughput. Leios's design would comfortably support this increased throughput
while maintaining decentralization.

### Threat model

> [!WARNING]
> TODO:
> - A short overview of the threat model
> - Highlight key 2-3 threats and mitigations
> - Link the [dedicated threat model](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/pull/452) once merged?
> - Link [threat model in report #1](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/technical-report-1.md#threat-model), [comments in report #2](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/technical-report-2.md#notes-on-the-leios-attack-surface)?

The Leios protocol may have to mitigate the following categories of threats.

- Grinding the VRF to obtain an advantage in Leios sortition
- Equivocating IBs, EBs, or RBs
- Declining to create IBs, EBs, or votes
- Manipulating the content of IBs or EBs
- Sending invalid txs, IBs, EBs, or certificates
- Abusing the sync protocol
- Delaying diffusion of IBs, EBs, or votes
- Submitting invalid, conflicting, or duplicate transactions

Nearly all of these _hypothetical_ threats are already mitigated by the protocol
design, the incentive structure, or the cost of the resources needed to execute
the threat. The
[Threat model](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-leios/blob/main/docs/technical-report-1.md#threat-model)
section of the first Leios Technical report contains a detailed taxonomy that we
summarize here. The general impact of such attacks varies:

- Resource burden on nodes
- Lowered throughput
- Increased latency
- Manipulation of dapps or oracles

_Grinding and other threats to Praos:_ Threats to the ranking blocks used by
Leios are already mitigated by Ouroboros Praos and Genesis. Nevertheless, the
possibility of _grinding attacks_, as discussed in
[CPS-0017](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/CIPs/blob/settlement-cps/CPS-0017/README.md),
will always exist, albeit at low probability of success. Such an attack, which
requires some stake, involves using CPU resources to try to manipulate the epoch
nonce to a value which will result in higher probability of being select as an
RB, IB, or EB producer or as a voter in a subsequent epoch. This presumes that
the Praos VRF will be used for the sortition in Leios. Currently, large and
expensive amounts of CPU power would be required to successfully conduct a grind
attack on Praos. Nevertheless, additional research and development are underway
to further harden Praos.

_Equivocation:_ In Leios, an IB producer, EB producers, or voter is only allowed
one production for each winning of the sortition lottery. (Note that they may
win more than once in the same slot because a lottery takes place for each
lovelace staked.) A malicious producer or voter might create two conflicting
IBs, EBs, or votes and diffuse them to different downstream peers in an attempt
to disrupt the Leios protocol. The [Leios paper][leios-paper] mitigates this
situation explicitly by identifying nodes that misbehave in this manner and
notifying downstream peers in a controlled manner.

_Inaction and nuisance:_ Producer nodes might also attempt to disrupt the
protocol by failing to play their assigned role or by attempting to diffuse
invalid information. Failing to produce a block (RB, IB, or EB) or to vote when
entitled will result in the attacker receiving fewer rewards for their Leios
work. Similarly for creating invalid blocks or votes. Very little advantage
would be gained by such attacks because they really only reduce throughput or
create a minor annoyance to their first downstream nodes by burdening them with
useless verification work. Presumably, the loss of rewards would not compensate
for the small disruption they create. The cryptographic aspects of Leios quickly
catch invalid blocks or votes, of course.

_Omission and manipulation:_ In Praos, omitting transactions from a block being
forged does not directly affect the producer's rewards, but it may reduce the
overall size of the rewards pot for the whole epoch. However, a malicious
producer has little leverage by such omissions because of the very high
probability that the omitted transactions reside elsewhere in the memory pool
and will soon be included in subsequent honest blocks. Reordering IBs when an EB
is created is not an option for an attacker because the Leios paper specifies a
fixed ordering.

_Network interference:_ Malicious network activity such as violating the sync
protocol or delaying diffusion of block or votes creates a minor annoyance that
the node's sync protocol will quickly avoid by preferring efficient and honest
nodes. Large numbers of malicious relays would be needed to impinge on
efficiency even in a small degree.

_Denial of service:_ Transaction-based denial of service attacks on Leios would
involve submitting numerous invalid, duplicate, or conflicting transactions to
different nodes so that they would all make their way into the memory pool and
then to IBs, only to be invalidated when transaction reconciliation occurs after
those IBs are indirectly referenced by a certificate on a Praos ranking block.
Such a denial of service would result in extra computation by the nodes and
wasted permanent storage in the IBs. (Plutus transactions may be especially
burdensome in this respect.) Ongoing research will mitigate such denial of
service via sharding techniques and Leios's fee structure. Sharding will prevent
duplicate transactions from reaching IBs and the fee structure will enforce
payment for intentionally conflicted transactions, even though only one of the
transactions would make it onto the ledger.

### Use cases

> [!WARNING]
> TODO:
> - Refer back to [CPS-18][cps-18] use cases and explain how proposed protocol improves them
> - Review and only mention use cases we have evidence for

Leios immediately enables use cases for high transaction volume and for more
computationally intensive Plutus scripts, but future minor modifications of the
protocol can open additional novel and custom transaction workflows.

#### High transaction volume

Prototype simulations of the Leios protocol indicate that it can achieve at
least 20 times the maximum throughput of the current Cardano mainnet. This
amounts to approximately 2 MB/s or 1500 tx/s, assuming the current mean
transaction size of 1400 bytes. The availability of Leios, however, would likely
affect the characteristics of the mix of transactions, so the maximum
transaction rate could be higher or lower than this estimate. Whatever the
specifics, Leios will enable transaction volumes that are orders of magnitude
greater than Praos.

Aside from the general benefit of high capacity, several specific use cases
could benefit.

- _Enterprise or national-state adoption:_ Enterprises and nation states require
  sustained and guaranteed scalability for their blockchain transactions, and
  large entities may become heavy users of Cardano.
- _Finance:_ High volume and high frequency trading may become more practical
  given the higher throughput supported by Leios.
- _Airdrops:_ The high throughput of Leios could streamline the user experience
  of claiming tokens for large (or extremely large) airdrops.
- _Partner chains, bridges, and oracles:_ Multiple simultaneous operation of
  partner chains, bridges, and oracles on Cardano will require high transaction
  rates and minimal delays from the time a transaction reaches the memory pool
  to when it is recorded in the ledger.
- _Games:_ High throughput and lower transaction cost may enable cost-effective
  coupling of games (e.g., markets for in-game items).
- _Improved user experience:_ From the onset of the Alonzo era, the usability of
  particular dapps has occasionally been constrained by the transaction
  throughput available on Praos. This is especially important and severe when a
  popular new dapps launches and experiences high activity. Congestion that
  sometimes occurs during spikes in transaction activity would be alleviated.
- _More complex governance actions:_ Expansion of Cardano and DAO governance
  would required high volumes of transactions if large portions of the community
  participate. This is particularly important if the number of dreps increases
  and Cardano moves towards a "direct democracy" style of voting.

#### Improved cost structure

Techno-economic analyses indicate that at a sustained transaction volume of 50
tx/s or greater the profitability profile of Cardano will improve in several
ways. If the current transaction fee structure remains the same as now, Leios
would have three economic effects at 50+ tx/s:

1. The intake of transaction fees would be large enough to lessen or eliminate
   the need for supplementing rewards from the Reserve pot. In particular, the
   `monetaryExpansion` protocol parameters to be lowered and/or the
   `treasuryCut` parameter could be increased.
2. Stake rewards would increase.
3. Stake pools would become more profitable. In particular, at 50+ tx/s the
   costlier Leios hardware would be overcome by higher rewards.
4. Transaction fees could be somewhat lowered. That could further drive adoption
   and make smaller transactions more cost effective, perhaps even opening the
   possibilities for micropayments or IoT applications.

The following plot shows a forecast for SPO profitability under Leios, assuming
a "business as usual" scenario where the fee, treasury, and monetary expansion
protocol parameter stay the same as presently. The precise profitability of
individual SPOs depends strongly upon how they host their nodes, but there is a
clear trend towards profitability (without any contributions from the Cardano
Reserve) once 30-50 transactions per second are sustained. Note that
profitability slows at very high throughput because of the substantial expense
of network egress and storage of the ledger.

#### Intensive Plutus execution

Because there typically is a time window of several seconds from the time a
Leios endorser block can be created to when voting must complete, there is also
an opportunity to do more computation validating transactions within an endorser
block than for a Praos ranking block. This opens the possibility of increasing
the Plutus execution budget for endorser blocks so that it is significantly
larger than the budget for Praos blocks. At the very least a script could be
allowed to use the whole Plutus execution budget for an endorser block, instead
of just one quarter of it as is the case for Praos.

Numerous emerging use cases on Cardano would benefit from larger Plutus
execution budgets. Complex dapps currently have to split a single logical
operation into a sequence of several transactions, increasing the development
effort, the complexity, and the attack surface of the scripts involved.

- _ZK proofs:_ It may be possible to increase the Plutus execution budget enough
  that a complete ZK proof could verified in a single transaction.
- _Large number of parties:_ Scripts managing potential interactions with a
  large number of parties (e.g., airdrops, lotteries, and local accounts) are
  intrinsically limited by Plutus execution limits.
- _On-chain interpreters:_ Dapps like Marlowe run interpreters for their DSL in
  a Plutus script. Execution limits currently restrict the complexity of the DSL
  expressions that can be evaluated in a single transaction.

#### Novel use cases

Although the version of Leios proposed in this document does not support the
particular use cases listed below, a minor variant or future version of Leios
could.

- _Priority pipelines:_ Different Leios pipelines might have different stage
  lengths, throughput, fees, and/or Plutus execution limits, enabling
  applications to select their level of service.
- _Externally batched endorser blocks:_ Third parties could construct endorser
  blocks and provide them directly to the block producers, allowing a dapp or an
  exchange detailed control over sequencing of interdependent transactions
  within the endorser block.
- _Nuanced roles for SPOs:_ Leios opens the possibility of separating the
  protocol functions into separate processes that could be run independently but
  in coordination. For example, some SPOs (or parts of an SPO) might focus on
  voting and validation while others might specialize in ranking block
  production. In addition to enabling flexible configuration of Cardano worker
  services, this could encourage new operational models for SPO consortia.

### Beyond this proposal & next steps

> Organised in two sub-sections:

- [ ] Clear evidence of stakeholder use cases that require the high transaction
      throughput that Leios provides.

### Acceptance criteria

> [!NOTE]
>
> Describes what are the acceptance criteria whereby a proposal becomes
> _'Active'_.
>
> This sub-section must define a list of criteria by which the proposal can
> become active. Criteria must relate to observable metrics or deliverables and
> be reviewed by editors and project maintainers when applicable. For example:
> "The changes to the ledger rules are implemented and deployed on Cardano
> mainnet by a majority of the network", or "The following key projects have
> implemented support for this standard".

- [ ] The revised `cardano-node` implementations pass the node-level conformance
      test suites.
- [ ] Audit.
- [ ] Successful operation in testnet environments.
- [ ] Community agreement on the settings for the Leios protocol parameters.

### Implementation plan

> [!NOTE] Either a plan to meet those criteria or `N/A` if not applicable.
>
> This sub-section should define the plan by which a proposal will meet its
> acceptance criteria, when applicable. More, proposals that require
> implementation work in a specific project may indicate one or more
> implementors. Implementors must sign off on the plan and be referenced in the
> document's preamble.
>
> In particular, an implementation that requires a hard-fork should explicitly
> mention it in its _'Implementation Plan'_.

- [ ] Detailed node-level (as opposed to this protocol-level) specification.
- [ ] Develop node-level conformance test suite.
- Consider developing a "quick and dirty" implementation for large scale
  experiments.
- Coordinate with related activities on other protocol enhancements.
  - Compatibility between Peras, Leios, and Genesis.
  - Common design and implementation for certificates, voting, and related key
    registration: Mithril, Peras, Leios, and partner chains.
- Triage by intersect Core Infrastructure, Consensus, Ledger, and Network
  functions.

## Versioning

> as a history of CIP files and directories.
>
> Authors are free to describe any approach to versioning that allows versioned

Leios will be versioned via the major and minor version numbers of the Cardano
protocol.
